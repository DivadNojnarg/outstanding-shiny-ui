<!-- HW: also needs to be updated given that Mastering Shiny now exists -->

Since the initial commit (https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/commit/e28b3da1badfecb34235e74a43aac4e8da1641bc) of Shiny in June 2012, the project has grown rapidly with users around the world across nearly every domain.  Strangely though there are nearly zero comprehensive resources collecting the scattered wisdom and experience of thousands of Shiny users and developers into a single definitive resource.  Fortunately, this book addresses the gap offering a detailed up-to-date compilation on Shiny to benefit users of all skill levels from beginner to advanced.  As I read through the early drafts, I kept saying to myself with a smile, "Yes, finally".  This book fills a void covering some topics for which an Internet search might yield no useful results.

Successful open source requires skillful developers, active engaged users, and helpful supporters.  In the R/Shiny community, David Granjon, PhD fulfills all three roles as a prolific R package creator, educated and thoughtful user with domain expertise, and educator (workshops, posts, and forum responses).  I cannot think of anyone more qualified to write a book on Shiny, and I am so happy that David has spent the time to generously share his wisdom and experience in this excellent resource.
