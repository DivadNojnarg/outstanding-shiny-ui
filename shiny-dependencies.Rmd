# Discover Shiny dependencies {#shiny-dependencies}
The simplest Shiny layout is the `fluidPage`. The `shinyapp` predefined Rstudio snippet will create a basic app skeleton (type shinyapp in RStudio IDE):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  p("Hello World")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

At first glance, the page only contains text. Wait ... are you sure about this? Let's run the above example and open the HTML inspector introduced in \@ref(survival-kit-html). Results are displayed on Figure \@ref(fig:shiny-deps).

```{r shiny-deps, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Shiny dependencies'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/shiny-deps.png")
```

We see in the head section, delimited by `<head></head>`, that Shiny has four dependencies:

- json2
- jQuery 3.4.1
- shiny (custom JavaScript and CSS)
- Bootstrap 3.4.1 (JavaScript and CSS) + other files (html5shiv, respond)

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) is here to provide plug and play design and interactions (tabs, navigation bars, tooltips, popovers, ...). For instance the `fluidRow` and `column` functions of Shiny leverage the Bootstrap grid to control how elements are displayed in a page. This is convenient because it avoids writing a large amount of CSS/JavaScript that essentially justs reinvents the wheel. 

As mentionned in Chapter \@ref(survival-kit-javascript), jQuery allows to perform DOM manipulation, that is interacting with HMTL elements, in a more user-friendly manner than with pure JavaScript.

Shiny has its own JS and CSS files. We will discuss some of them later in this section.

Finally, json2 is a library to handle the [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) data format (JavaScript Object Notation). In the following chapters we will use it a lot, through the [jsonlite](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/index.html) package that allows to transform JSON objects in R objects and inversely. 

In summary, all these libraries are necessary to make Shiny what it is!
