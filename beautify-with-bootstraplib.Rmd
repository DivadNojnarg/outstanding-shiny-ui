# Beautify with `{bslib}` {#beautify-with-bootstraplib}
`{bslib}` [@R-bslib] is a package developed by RStudio. It is built on top `{sass}` like `{fresh}` [@R-fresh]. 

## Disclaimer

This feature requires [`{shiny} >= 1.6.0`](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/02/01/shiny-1-6-0/).

## Plug and play customization
Like `{fresh}`, `{bslib}` offers a high level set of functions allowing to quickly customize shiny apps. For many users, this step will be enough. `bs_theme` allows to seamlessly modify the main CSS properties like:

  - The background color, namely `bg`.
  - The foreground color, namely `fg`.
  - Change default theme colors, also called [accents](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/colors/).
  - Modify the [font](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/articles/theming.html#main-colors-fonts). This leverages the `font_google`, `font_face` and `font_link` functions. In practice,
  `font_google` also allows to cache the font resources so that they are always available to the user. 
  
Additionally, it gives the flexibility to choose Bootstrap version with `version_default`. As shown in Chapter \@ref(web-dependencies), Shiny primarily relies on Bootstrap 3. This function has 3 flavors:

  - Bootstrap 3, with `"3"`.
  - Bootstrap 4 + compatibility with Bootstrap 3, with `"4"`.
  
Advanced users appreciate a `...` slot to add extra variables through `bs_add_variables`, with literally hundreds
of choices.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(bslib)

bs_theme(
  version = version_default(),
  bootswatch = NULL,
  ...,
  bg = NULL,
  fg = NULL,
  primary = NULL,
  secondary = NULL,
  success = NULL,
  info = NULL,
  warning = NULL,
  danger = NULL,
  base_font = NULL,
  code_font = NULL,
  heading_font = NULL
)
```

`bs_update_theme` is able to update a give theme object, generated with `bs_theme`.

At any time, developers may preview to resulting theme with `bs_theme_preview`, passing the newly created theme as main parameter. For instance:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
neon_theme <- bs_theme(
  bg = "#000000", 
  fg = "#FFFFFF", 
  primary = "#9600FF", 
  secondary = "#1900A0",
  success = "#38FF12",
  info = "#00F5FB",
  warning = "#FFF100",
  danger = "#FF00E3",
  base_font = "Marker Felt",
  heading_font = "Marker Felt",
  code_font = "Chalkduster"
)
bs_theme_preview(neon_theme, with_themer = FALSE)
```

..

This gives the result shown in Figure \@ref(fig:bootstraplib-theme-preview).

```{r bootstraplib-theme-preview, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='bs_theme_preview feature in action', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/beautify/bootstraplib-theme-preview.png")
```

Passing `with_themer = TRUE` will show a live theming tools to modify the current theme.

## Dynamic theming
Now, let's say you design an app and want to give the choice between the vanilla shiny design and your new cyberpunk theme, created in the previous section. We leverage the new `session$setCurrentTheme` tool that allows to pass `{bslib}` generated themes to JavaScript through the session object. Our Shiny app contains a toggle, which value is either TRUE or FALSE. On the JavaScript side, we first create a custom shiny input with `Shiny.setInputValue` that get the current mode value from the toggle. If TRUE, then the custom theme is applied by `session$setCurrentTheme` in an `observeEvent`.

As the `{bslib}` theme does not apply to static plots (they are not HTML element, thus not part of the DOM), we leverage [`{thematic}`](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/), that in short,
provides a sort of CSS interface for base R plots, ggplot and lattice. Specifically, in the 
Shiny context, we choose `thematic_shiny()`. By default, it sets the appropriate background,
foreground and accent colors, like `{bslib}`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(thematic)

theme_toggle <- function() {
  div(
    class = "custom-control custom-switch", 
    tags$input(
      id = "custom_mode", type = "checkbox", class = "custom-control-input",
      onclick = HTML("Shiny.setInputValue('dark_mode', document.getElementById('custom_mode').value);")
    ),
    tags$label(
      "Custom mode?", `for` = "custom_mode", class = "custom-control-label"
    )
  )
}

default <- bs_theme()
ui <- fluidPage(
  theme = default, 
  theme_toggle(),
  sliderInput("obs", "Number of observations:",
    min = 0, max = 1000, value = 500
  ),
  plotOutput("distPlot")
)
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  observeEvent(input$custom_mode, {
    session$setCurrentTheme(
      if (input$custom_mode) neon_theme else default
    )
  })
  
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    Sys.sleep(2)
    hist(rnorm(input$obs))
  })
}
thematic_shiny()
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

__Note__: An issue with `shiny::bindCache` described [here](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues/3208), with shiny 1.6.


## Custom elements
For other elements than core shiny components like `numericInput` or `{thematic}` compatible elements such as `plotOutput`,
`{bslib}` provides tools to create dynamically themeable custom components. 

Let's take the example of a simple card where the Sass code is defined below:

  - `.supercard` has a shadow, takes half of the page width and has a fixed height.
  Notice the `background-color` that takes the value of the `$primary` SAAS variable,
  inherited from Bootstrap 4. 
  - `.supercard_body` adds padding to the card body content.

```scss
.supercard {
    box-shadow: 0 4px 10px 0 rgb(0, 0, 0), 0 4px 20px 0 rgb(0, 0, 0);
    width: 50%;
    height: 200px;
    background-color: $primary;
    
    .supercard_body {
      padding: 0.01em 16px;
    }
}
```

Below, for convenience, we put that Sass code inside a R string, even though best practice would
be to save it in a file and compile it with `sass::sass_file`. 

```{r}
sass_str <- "
  .supercard {
    box-shadow: 0 4px 10px 0 rgb(0, 0, 0), 0 4px 20px 0 rgb(0, 0, 0);
    width: 50%;
    height: 200px;
    
    background-color: $primary;
    .supercard_body {
      padding: 0.01em 16px;
    }
}"
```


If you try to run `sass::sass(input = sass_str)`,
it will fail, as `$primary` is not defined. Now the goal is to link this custom Sass code
to the main app theme, created with `bs_theme`. We leverage the `bs_dependency` function where:

  - `input` refers to a list of Sass rules, that is `sass_str` in our example.
  - `theme` is a theme generated with `bs_theme`.
  - `name` and `version` are metadata.
  
In case we are not in a `{bslib}` context, ie the app does not pass a `bs_theme` element,
we create a fallback containing the card CSS code.

```{r}
library(htmltools)
super_card_dependency <- function(theme) {
  
  dep_name <- "supercard"
  dep_version <- "1.0.0"
  
  if (is_bs_theme(theme)) {
    bs_dependency(
      input = sass_str,
      theme = theme,
      name = dep_name,
      version = dep_version
    )
  } else {
    htmlDependency(
      name = dep_name,
      version = dep_version,
      src = "supercard-1.0.0/css",
      stylesheet = "super-card.css",
      package = "OSUICode"
    )
  }
}
```

As shown, in Chapter \@ref(htmltools-dependencies), we have to add this dependency to the card
tag. Importantly, we wrap it inside `bs_dependency_defer` that enables us to dynamically update the theme on the server
side, each time `session$setCurrentTheme` is invoked. 

```{r}
super_card <- function(...) {
  div(
    class = "supercard",
    div(class = "supercard_body", ...),
    bs_dependency_defer(super_card_dependency)
  )
}
```

We then create two simple theme, namely
white and dark and run the app:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
white_theme <- bs_theme()
dark_theme <- white_theme %>% 
  bs_theme_update(bg = "black", fg = "white", primary = "orange")


ui <- fluidPage(
  theme = white_theme,
  theme_toggle(),
  br(),
  super_card("Hello World!")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  observeEvent(input$custom_mode, {
    session$setCurrentTheme(
      if (input$custom_mode) dark_theme else white_theme
    )
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

The reader is invited to exploit the `run_with_themer` capabilities, that allows
to dynamically modify the current them, as shown Figure \@ref(fig:bslib-custom-component).

```{r bslib-custom-component, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='bs_theme_preview with custom component', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/beautify/bslib-custom-component.png")
```

Below, we try without passing any theme to `fluidPage`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(super_card("Hello World!"))
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```
