# Beautify with `{bslib}` {#beautify-with-bootstraplib}
`{bslib}` [@R-bslib] is a package developed by RStudio, built on top `{sass}`.
At the time of writing, `{bslib}` does not support `{shinydashboard}` and `{bs4Dash}`.
Again, you'll see that in few lines of code, you may provide impressive
design modifications to your apps, in a ridiculously short amount of time.

## Disclaimer

::: {.importantblock data-latex=""}
`{bslib}` requires [`{shiny} >= 1.6.0`](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/02/01/shiny-1-6-0/).
:::

## High level customization
Like `{fresh}`, `{bslib}` offers a high level set of functions allowing to quickly customize shiny apps. For many users, this step will be enough. 


### Create a theme {#bslib-high-level}

`bs_theme()` seamlessly modifies the main CSS properties like:

  - The __background__ color, namely `bg`.
  - The __foreground__ color, namely `fg`.
  - Change default __theme__ colors, also called [accents](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/colors/).
  - Modify the [font](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/articles/theming.html#main-colors-fonts). This leverages the `font_google()`, `font_face()` and `font_link()` functions. In practice, `font_google()` caches the font resources so that they are always available to the user.

Additionally, it gives the flexibility to choose __Bootstrap version__ with `version_default()`. As shown in Chapter \@ref(web-dependencies), Shiny primarily relies on Bootstrap 3. This function has three flavors:

  - __Bootstrap 3__, with `"3"`.
  - __Bootstrap 4__ + compatibility with Bootstrap 3, with `"4"`.
  - More __Bootstrap__ versions 

Advanced users appreciate a `...` slot to add extra variables through `bs_add_variables()`, with literally hundreds of choices. We give more details in the \@ref(bslib-low-level) section.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(bslib)

bs_theme(
  version = version_default(),
  bootswatch = NULL,
  ...,
  bg = NULL,
  fg = NULL,
  primary = NULL,
  secondary = NULL,
  success = NULL,
  info = NULL,
  warning = NULL,
  danger = NULL,
  base_font = NULL,
  code_font = NULL,
  heading_font = NULL
)
```

Let's create a very simple theme:

```{r}
simple_bs4_theme <- bs_theme(version = 4)
```

We deliberately trimmed the corresponding output to get a better rendering in the book. 

```
/* Sass Bundle: _root, _reboot, ..., _toasts, _modal, ... */

/* MORE Sass imports ... */

@import "../scss/_toasts.scss";
@import "../scss/_modal.scss";

.table th[align=left] { text-align: left; }
.table th[align=right] { text-align: right; }
.table th[align=center] { text-align: center; }

/* MORE Sass imports ... */

/* *** */

Other Sass Bundle information:
List of 2
 $ html_deps       :List of 1
  ..$ :List of 10
  .. ..$ name      : chr "bs3compat"
  .. ..$ version   : chr "0.2.5.9002"
  .. ..$ src       :List of 1
  .. .. ..$ file: chr "bs3compat/js"
  .. ..$ meta      : NULL
  .. ..$ script    : chr [1:3] "transition.js" "tabs.js" 
  "bs3compat.js"
  .. ..$ stylesheet: NULL
  .. ..$ head      : NULL
  .. ..$ attachment: NULL
  .. ..$ package   : chr "bslib"
  .. ..$ all_files : logi TRUE
  .. ..- attr(*, "class")= chr "html_dependency"
 $ file_attachments: Named chr "..."
  ..- attr(*, "names")= chr "fonts"
```

At a glance, the output contains a bundle with Sass code for all Bootstrap 4 components (toasts, modals, ...). Then, each of those modules are imported with the __@import__ statement. The remaining consists in an HTML dependency providing compatibility with Bootstrap 3 and fonts assets. 

### Update a theme
`{bslib}` exposes handy functions to alter the theme Sass code, that is remove (`bs_remove()`) or add (`bs_theme_update()`) rules to/from a preexisting theme. This may be useful to reduce the code size or add missing rules on the fly. For instance, if we don't need to alter the toast component, there is no need to include its Sass code in the theme. We therefore do:

```{r}
simple_bs4_theme <- bs_remove(simple_bs4_theme, "_toasts")
```

Inversely, if we missed a CSS rule, we may leverage `bs_theme_update()`, which is able to update a given theme object, generated with `bs_theme()`. Below, we change the default primary color (<span style="width:12px;height:12px;background:#007bff;border-radius:2px;display:inline-block;margin-right:5px;"></span>) to a lighter blue: 

```{r}
simple_bs4_theme <- bs_theme_update(
  simple_bs4_theme, 
  primary = htmltools::parseCssColors("lightblue")
)
```

As stated in the previous chapter, don't mess too much with the color logic. For instance, setting `primary = htmltools::parseCssColors("pink")` is a rather bad idea. 

Note the use of `htmltools::parseCssColors()` which converts a color name to the corresponding HEX code:

```{r}
htmltools::parseCssColors("blue")
htmltools::parseCssColors("gainsboro")
```

### Preview a theme
At any time, developers may preview the resulting theme with `bs_theme_preview()`, for instance:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
neon_theme <- bs_theme(
  bg = "#000000",
  fg = "#FFFFFF",
  primary = "#9600FF",
  secondary = "#1900A0",
  success = "#38FF12",
  info = "#00F5FB",
  warning = "#FFF100",
  danger = "#FF00E3",
  base_font = "Marker Felt",
  heading_font = "Marker Felt",
  code_font = "Chalkduster"
)
bs_theme_preview(neon_theme, with_themer = FALSE)
```

This gives the result shown on Figure \@ref(fig:bootstraplib-theme-preview).

```{r bootstraplib-theme-preview, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Theme preview in action', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/beautify/bootstraplib-theme-preview.png")
```

### Live theming
Let's go even further! Wouldn't be that cool to be able to modify the app at runtime with a plug and play widget? This is possible with `{bslib}`, owing to the `run_with_themer()` wrapper. 
It takes a Shiny App object as input (ie defined with `shiny::shinyApp()`):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  theme = neon_theme,
  tabsetPanel(
    tabPanel("First tab",
      "The contents of the first tab",
      actionButton("test", "Test")
    ),
    tabPanel("Second tab",
      "The contents of the second tab"
    )
  )
)
server <- function(input, output, session) {}
run_with_themer(shinyApp(ui, server))
```

As depicted by Figure \@ref(fig:bslib-bs-themer), the themer not only shows a live
theming widget. It also shows the corresponding code output step by step, so as to
update the original theme. Under the hood, it leverages the `bs_theme_update()` function, described above.  

```{r bslib-bs-themer, echo=FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "50%", fig.align = "default", fig.cap="Live theming with bslib. Left: themer widget. Right: code output."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/beautify/bslib-bs-themer-app.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/beautify/bslib-bs-themer-code.png")
```

Alternatively, passing `with_themer = TRUE` inside `bs_theme_preview` does also the same thing.
There are few limitations and we refer the reader to the official [documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/reference/run_with_themer.html#limitations). 
Even though there exists a third function, namely `bs_themer`, I don't encourage using it, as it has to be inserted in the server function, which can be easily forgotten by mistake. 

## Low level customization {#bslib-low-level}

### Add new variables
`bs_add_variables()` adds new variables at a specific position within a theme. By default, they are inserted before other Sass __defaults__. It is a lower level function since you have to
know the corresponding Bootstrap variable(s). Let's consider the example of a Bootstrap 4 badge where we aim at changing the font size, font weight and padding. The corresponding Sass code may be found [here](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/5d24fef741944c168ad0ca9cabd1509d5803e441/scss/_badge.scss), and we identify few variables, whose default values are shown in the Bootstrap 4 variables code [here](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/scss/_variables.scss):

```scss
// Typography
//
// Font, line-height, and color for body text, headings, and more.
$font-weight-bold:        700 !default;

// Define common padding and border radius sizes and more.
$border-radius:           .25rem !default;

// Badges

$badge-font-size:         75% !default;
$badge-font-weight:       $font-weight-bold !default;
$badge-padding-y:         .25em !default;
$badge-padding-x:         .4em !default;
$badge-border-radius:     $border-radius !default;
```

Now we create our custom theme, increasing the font weight, size and changing the border radius to obtain more rounder [corners](https://shoelace.style/tokens/border-radius):

```{r}
library(magrittr)

custom_badge_theme <- bs_theme(
  version = 4,
  # high level theming  
  success = htmltools::parseCssColors("lightgreen")
) %>% 
  bs_add_variables(
    # low level theming
    "badge-font-weight" = 900,
    "badge-font-size" = "100%",
    "badge-padding-y" = "0.5em",
    "badge-padding-x" = "0.8em",
    "badge-border-radius" = "1rem"
  )
```

Note: it would be tempting to change the global `$font-weight-bold` but it might affect
other elements. Let's just overwrite the `badge-font-weight`. 

The badge code is given by the following HTML:

```html
<span class="badge badge-success">Success</span>
```

We leverage our previous knowledge to convert it to R and make it browsable with `{htmltools}`:

```{r}
library(htmltools)

my_badge <- tags$a(class = "badge badge-success", "1")
preview_badge <- function(theme = NULL) {
  if (interactive()) {
    tag <- if (is.null(theme)) {
      # default bs4 theme
      bs_theme(version = 4)
    } else {
      # altered badge
      theme
    }
    browsable(
      tags$body(
        br(), 
        bs_theme_dependencies(theme), 
        my_badge
      )
    )
  }
}

# preview_badge(custom_badge_theme)
# preview_badge() # default badge
```

```{r bslib-custom-badge, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Custom Bootstrao 4 badge with bslib. Left: custom badge, right: default badge.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/beautify/bslib-custom-badge.png")
```

`bs_theme_dependencies` is used outside of a Shiny context to include the theme Sass code as a dependency. 

### Import external rules
Let's try with another example. We would like to bring a refreshment to the Bootstrap UI elements with one of the most modern UI kit to date, namely [98.css](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/), a Windows 98 CSS kit. The CSS assets may be accessed from [jsdelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/98.css@0.1.16/dist/98.min.css), as shown below:

```{r}
win98_cdn <- "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/98.css@0.1.16/"
win98_css <- paste0(win98_cdn, "dist/98.min.css")
```

`{bslib}` exposes neat tools to import extra CSS in the current theme, such as `bs_add_rules()`, which calls `sass::sass_file()` under the hood:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
theme %>%
  bs_add_rules(
    sprintf('@import %s', win98_css)
  )
```

The three theme colors are `#c0c0c0` for the background and all colors (except primary), `#03158b` for primary and `#222222` for the text. We also disable the rounded option so that button borders stay squared.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

windows_grey <- "#c0c0c0"
windows98_theme <- bs_theme(
  bg = windows_grey,
  fg = "#222222",
  primary = "#03158b",
  base_font = c("Times", "Arial"),
  secondary = windows_grey,
  success = windows_grey,
  danger = windows_grey,
  info = windows_grey,
  light = windows_grey,
  dark = windows_grey,
  warning = windows_grey,
  "font-size-base" = "0.75rem",
  "enable-rounded" = FALSE
) %>%
  bs_add_rules(
    sprintf('@import "%s"', win98_css)
  )

windows98_theme %>% bs_theme_preview()
```

When you run the above demonstration, you'll notice that the slider input is not properly
styled. It's not surprising knowing that the slider is not shaped by Bootstrap but [Ion.RangeSlider](http://ionden.com/a/plugins/ion.rangeSlider/). Therefore, if you want a better appearance, like in [98.css](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/#slider), we would need extra work. The output is shown Figure \@ref(fig:bslib-windows-98).

```{r bslib-windows-98, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Modern Windows 98 theme for Shiny', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/beautify/bslib-windows-98.png")
```

## Dynamic theming

### Basics 
Now, let's say you design an app and want to give the choice between the vanilla shiny design and your new cyberpunk theme, created in the previous section. We leverage the new `session$setCurrentTheme` feature that allows to pass `{bslib}` generated themes to JavaScript through the __session__ object. Our Shiny app contains a toggle, which value is either TRUE or FALSE. On the JavaScript side, we first create a custom shiny input with `Shiny.setInputValue` that gets the current mode value from the toggle. If TRUE, then the custom theme is applied by `session$setCurrentTheme` in an `observeEvent()`.

Like for `{fresh}`, the `{bslib}` theme does not apply to static plots, as they are not HTML elements. Therefore we load `{thematic}`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(thematic)

theme_toggle <- function() {
  div(
    class = "custom-control custom-switch",
    tags$input(
      id = "custom_mode",
      type = "checkbox",
      class = "custom-control-input",
      onclick = HTML(
        "Shiny.setInputValue(
          'dark_mode',
          document.getElementById('custom_mode').value
        );"
      )
    ),
    tags$label(
      "Custom mode?",
      `for` = "custom_mode",
      class = "custom-control-label"
    )
  )
}

default <- bs_theme()
ui <- fluidPage(
  theme = default,
  theme_toggle(),
  sliderInput("obs", "Number of observations:",
    min = 0, max = 1000, value = 500
  ),
  plotOutput("distPlot")
)
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  observeEvent(input$custom_mode, {
    session$setCurrentTheme(
      if (input$custom_mode) neon_theme else default
    )
  })

  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    hist(rnorm(input$obs))
  })
}
thematic_shiny()
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

::: {.warningblock data-latex=""}
At the time of writing, an issue with `bindCache()` not aware of `session$setCurrentTheme()` is described [here](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues/3208), with `{shiny}` 1.6.
:::

### Custom elements
For other elements than core shiny components like `numericInput()` or `{thematic}` compatible elements such as `plotOutput()`, `{bslib}` provides tools to design dynamically themeable custom components.

Let's take the example of a simple card where the Sass code is defined below:

  - `.supercard` has a shadow, takes half of the page width and has a fixed height.
  Notice the `background-color` that takes the value of the `$primary` Sass variable,
  inherited from Bootstrap 4.
  - `.supercard_body` adds padding to the card body content.

```scss
.supercard {
    box-shadow: 0 4px 10px 0 rgb(0, 0, 0), 0 4px 20px 0
    rgb(0, 0, 0);
    width: 50%;
    height: 200px;
    background-color: $primary;

    .supercard_body {
      padding: 0.01em 16px;
    }
}
```

Below, for convenience, we put that Sass code inside a R string, even though best practice would
be to save it in a file and compile it with `sass_file()`.

```{r}
sass_str <- "
  .supercard {
    box-shadow: 0 4px 10px 0 rgb(0, 0, 0), 0 4px 20px 0
    rgb(0, 0, 0);
    width: 50%;
    height: 200px;

    background-color: $primary;
    .supercard_body {
      padding: 0.01em 16px;
    }
}"
```


If you try to run `sass(input = sass_str)`,
it will fail, as `$primary` is not defined. Now, the goal is to link this custom Sass code
to the main app theme, created with `bs_theme()`. We invoke the `bs_dependency()` function where:

  - __input__ refers to a list of Sass rules, that is `sass_str` in our example.
  - __theme__ is a theme generated with `bs_theme()`.
  - __name__ and `version` are metadata.

In case we are not in a `{bslib}` context, ie the app does not pass a `bs_theme()` element,
we create a fallback containing the card CSS code:

```{r}
library(htmltools)
super_card_dependency <- function(theme) {

  dep_name <- "supercard"
  dep_version <- "1.0.0"

  if (is_bs_theme(theme)) {
    bs_dependency(
      input = sass_str,
      theme = theme,
      name = dep_name,
      version = dep_version
    )
  } else {
    htmlDependency(
      name = dep_name,
      version = dep_version,
      src = "supercard-1.0.0/css",
      stylesheet = "super-card.css",
      package = "OSUICode"
    )
  }
}
```

As shown, in Chapter \@ref(htmltools-dependencies), we have to add this dependency to the card
tag. Importantly, we wrap it inside `bs_dependency_defer()` that enables us to dynamically update the theme on the server
side, each time `session$setCurrentTheme` is called:

```{r}
super_card <- function(...) {
  div(
    class = "supercard",
    div(class = "supercard_body", ...),
    bs_dependency_defer(super_card_dependency)
  )
}
```

We then create two simple theme, namely white and dark and run the app:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
white_theme <- bs_theme()
dark_theme <- white_theme %>%
  bs_theme_update(
    bg = "black",
    fg = "white",
    primary = "orange"
  )


ui <- fluidPage(
  theme = white_theme,
  theme_toggle(),
  br(),
  super_card("Hello World!")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  observeEvent(input$custom_mode, {
    session$setCurrentTheme(
      if (input$custom_mode) dark_theme else white_theme
    )
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

::: {.importantblock data-latex=""}
Live theming requires to pass the __session__ parameter to the server function. Don't forget it!
:::

The reader is invited to exploit the `run_with_themer()` capabilities, that allows
to dynamically modify the current theme, as shown Figure \@ref(fig:bslib-custom-component).

```{r bslib-custom-component, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Theme preview with custom component', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/beautify/bslib-custom-component.png")
```

Below, we try without passing any theme to `fluidPage()`, to test our CSS fall back strategy:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(super_card("Hello World!"))
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```


### Advanced
The above approach allows us to apply a theme based on a user input, like a theme switcher. 
However, we can't access and modify the theme at run time to apply specific rendering properties.
Let's go further! How do we recover the currently active theme on the server side? Look no further, `bs_current_theme()` is the weapon you need:  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  theme = bs_theme(version = 4),
  verbatimTextOutput("current_theme")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$current_theme <- renderPrint(bs_current_theme())
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

In a reactive context (Shiny), this calls `session$getCurrentTheme()`. 

`tagAddRenderHook()`: https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/pull/3372/files#diff-befe9146792f0d65aeeaf781e8ba00a1a3638ac2be162b61b6c8958440860b56R1029-R1040,
