# Beautify with bslib {#beautify-with-bootstraplib}
`{bslib}` [@R-bslib] is a package developed by RStudio. It is built on top `{sass}` like `{fresh}` [@R-fresh]. 

## Disclaimer 

::: {.importantblock data-latex=""}
As of today, this feature still require development version (github) of `{shiny}` and `{bslib}`!

## Plug and play customization
Like `{fresh}`, `{bslib}` offers a high level set of functions allowing to quickly customize shiny apps. For many users, this step will be enough. `bs_theme` allows to seamlessly modify the main CSS properties like:

  - The background color, namely `bg`.
  - The foreground color, namely `fg`.
  - Change default theme colors, also called [accents](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/colors/).
  - Modify the [font](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/articles/theming.html#main-colors-fonts). This leverages the `font_google`, `font_face` and `font_link` functions. In practice,
  `font_google` also allows to cache the font resources so that they are always available to the user. 
  
Additionally, it gives the flexibility to choose Bootstrap version with `version_default`. As shown in Chapter \@ref(web-dependencies), Shiny primarily relies on Bootstrap 3. This function has 3 flavors:

  - Bootstrap 3, with `"3"`.
  - Bootstrap 4 + compatibility with Bootstrap 3, with `"4"`.
  
Advanced users appreciate a `...` slot to add extra variables through `bs_add_variables`, with literally hundreds
of choices.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(bslib)

bs_theme(
  version = version_default(),
  bootswatch = NULL,
  ...,
  bg = NULL,
  fg = NULL,
  primary = NULL,
  secondary = NULL,
  success = NULL,
  info = NULL,
  warning = NULL,
  danger = NULL,
  base_font = NULL,
  code_font = NULL,
  heading_font = NULL
)
```

`bs_update_theme` is able to update a give theme object, generated with `bs_theme`.

At any time, developers may preview to resulting theme with `bs_theme_preview`, passing the newly created theme as main parameter. For instance:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
neon_theme <- bs_theme(
  bg = "#000000", 
  fg = "#FFFFFF", 
  primary = "#9600FF", 
  secondary = "#1900A0",
  success = "#38FF12",
  info = "#00F5FB",
  warning = "#FFF100",
  danger = "#FF00E3",
  base_font = "Marker Felt",
  heading_font = "Marker Felt",
  code_font = "Chalkduster"
)
bs_theme_preview(neon_theme, with_themer = FALSE)
```

This gives the result shown in Figure \@ref(fig:bootstraplib-theme-preview).

```{r bootstraplib-theme-preview, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='bs_theme_preview feature in action', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/beautify/bootstraplib-theme-preview.png")
```

Passing `with_themer = TRUE` will show a live theming tools to modify the current theme.

## Dynamic theming
Now, let's say you design an app and want to give the choice between the vanilla shiny design and your new cyberpunk theme, created in the previous section. We leverage the new `session$setCurrentTheme` tool that allows to pass `{bslib}` generated themes to JavaScript through the session object. Our Shiny app contains a toggle, which value is either TRUE or FALSE. On the JavaScript side, we first create a custom shiny input with `Shiny.setInputValue` that get the current mode value from the toggle. If TRUE, then the custom theme is applied by `session$setCurrentTheme` in an `observeEvent`.

As the `{bslib}` theme does not apply to static plots (they are not HTML element, thus not part of the DOM), we leverage [`{thematic}`](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/), that in short,
provides a sort of CSS interface for base R plots, ggplot and lattice. Specifically, in the 
Shiny context, we choose `thematic_shiny()`. By default, it sets the appropriate background,
foreground and accent colors, like `{bslib}`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(thematic)
default <- bs_theme()
ui <- fluidPage(
  theme = default, 
  div(
    class = "custom-control custom-switch", 
    tags$input(
      id = "custom_mode", type = "checkbox", class = "custom-control-input",
      onclick = HTML("Shiny.setInputValue('dark_mode', document.getElementById('custom_mode').value);")
    ),
    tags$label(
      "Custom mode?", `for` = "custom_mode", class = "custom-control-label"
    )
  ),
  sliderInput("obs", "Number of observations:",
    min = 0, max = 1000, value = 500
  ),
  plotOutput("distPlot")
)
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  observeEvent(input$custom_mode, {
    session$setCurrentTheme(
      if (input$custom_mode) neon_theme else default
    )
  })
  
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    Sys.sleep(2)
    hist(rnorm(input$obs))
  })
}
thematic_shiny()
shinyApp(ui, server)
```
