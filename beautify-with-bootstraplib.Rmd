# Beautify with `{bslib}` {#beautify-with-bootstraplib}
`{bslib}` [@R-bslib] is a package developed by RStudio. It is built on top `{sass}` like `{fresh}` [@R-fresh]. 

## Disclaimer

This feature requires [`{shiny} >= 1.6.0`](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/02/01/shiny-1-6-0/).

## Plug and play customization
Like `{fresh}`, `{bslib}` offers a high level set of functions allowing to quickly customize shiny apps. For many users, this step will be enough. `bs_theme()` seamlessly modifies the main CSS properties like:

  - The __background__ color, namely `bg`.
  - The __foreground__ color, namely `fg`.
  - Change default __theme__ colors, also called [accents](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/colors/).
  - Modify the [font](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/articles/theming.html#main-colors-fonts). This leverages the `font_google()`, `font_face()` and `font_link()` functions. In practice, `font_google()` caches the font resources so that they are always available to the user. 
  
Additionally, it gives the flexibility to choose __Bootstrap version__ with `version_default()`. As shown in Chapter \@ref(web-dependencies), Shiny primarily relies on Bootstrap 3. This function has three flavors:

  - __Bootstrap 3__, with `"3"`.
  - __Bootstrap 4__ + compatibility with Bootstrap 3, with `"4"`.
  
Advanced users appreciate a `...` slot to add extra variables through `bs_add_variables()`, with literally hundreds of choices.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(bslib)

bs_theme(
  version = version_default(),
  bootswatch = NULL,
  ...,
  bg = NULL,
  fg = NULL,
  primary = NULL,
  secondary = NULL,
  success = NULL,
  info = NULL,
  warning = NULL,
  danger = NULL,
  base_font = NULL,
  code_font = NULL,
  heading_font = NULL
)
```

`bs_update_theme()` is able to update a give theme object, generated with `bs_theme()`.

At any time, developers may preview the resulting theme with `bs_theme_preview()`, for instance:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
neon_theme <- bs_theme(
  bg = "#000000", 
  fg = "#FFFFFF", 
  primary = "#9600FF", 
  secondary = "#1900A0",
  success = "#38FF12",
  info = "#00F5FB",
  warning = "#FFF100",
  danger = "#FF00E3",
  base_font = "Marker Felt",
  heading_font = "Marker Felt",
  code_font = "Chalkduster"
)
bs_theme_preview(neon_theme, with_themer = FALSE)
```

This gives the result shown on Figure \@ref(fig:bootstraplib-theme-preview).

```{r bootstraplib-theme-preview, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='bs_theme_preview in action', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/beautify/bootstraplib-theme-preview.png")
```

Passing `with_themer = TRUE` will show a __live theming tools__ to modify the current theme.

Let's try with another example. We would like to bring a refreshment to the Bootstrap UI elements with one of the most modern UI kit to date, namely [98.css](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/), a Windows 98 CSS kit. The CSS assets may be accessed from [jsdelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/98.css@0.1.16/dist/98.min.css), as shown below. `{bslib}` exposes neat tools to import extra CSS in the current theme, such as `bs_add_rules()`, which calls `sass::sass_file()` under the hood: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
theme %>% 
  bs_add_rules(
    '@import "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/98.css@0.1.16/dist/98.min.css"'
  )
```

The three theme colors are `#c0c0c0` for the background and all colors (except primary), `#03158b` for primary and `#222222` for the text. We also disable the rounded option so that button borders stay squared.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
windows_grey <- "#c0c0c0"
windows98_theme <- bs_theme(
  bg = windows_grey, 
  fg = "#222222", 
  primary = "#03158b",
  base_font = c("Times", "Arial"), 
  secondary = windows_grey, 
  success = windows_grey, 
  danger = windows_grey, 
  info = windows_grey, 
  light = windows_grey, 
  dark = windows_grey, 
  warning = windows_grey,
  "font-size-base" = "0.75rem", 
  "enable-rounded" = FALSE
) %>%
  bs_add_rules(
    '@import "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/98.css@0.1.16/dist/98.min.css"'
  ) 

windows98_theme %>% bs_theme_preview()
```

When you run the above demonstration, you'll notice that the slider input is not properly
styled. It's not surprising knowing that the slider is not shaped by Bootstrap but [Ion.RangeSlider](http://ionden.com/a/plugins/ion.rangeSlider/). Therefore, if you want a better appearance, like in [98.css](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/#slider), we would need extra work. The output is shown Figure \@ref(fig:bslib-windows-98).

```{r bslib-windows-98, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Modern Windows 98 theme for Shiny', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/beautify/bslib-windows-98.png")
```

## Dynamic theming
Now, let's say you design an app and want to give the choice between the vanilla shiny design and your new cyberpunk theme, created in the previous section. We leverage the new `session$setCurrentTheme` feature that allows to pass `{bslib}` generated themes to JavaScript through the __session__ object. Our Shiny app contains a toggle, which value is either TRUE or FALSE. On the JavaScript side, we first create a custom shiny input with `Shiny.setInputValue` that gets the current mode value from the toggle. If TRUE, then the custom theme is applied by `session$setCurrentTheme` in an `observeEvent()`.

Like for `{fresh}`, the `{bslib}` theme does not apply to static plots, as they are not HTML elements. Therefore we load `{thematic}`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(thematic)

theme_toggle <- function() {
  div(
    class = "custom-control custom-switch", 
    tags$input(
      id = "custom_mode", type = "checkbox", class = "custom-control-input",
      onclick = HTML("Shiny.setInputValue('dark_mode', document.getElementById('custom_mode').value);")
    ),
    tags$label(
      "Custom mode?", `for` = "custom_mode", class = "custom-control-label"
    )
  )
}

default <- bs_theme()
ui <- fluidPage(
  theme = default, 
  theme_toggle(),
  sliderInput("obs", "Number of observations:",
    min = 0, max = 1000, value = 500
  ),
  plotOutput("distPlot")
)
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  observeEvent(input$custom_mode, {
    session$setCurrentTheme(
      if (input$custom_mode) neon_theme else default
    )
  })
  
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    hist(rnorm(input$obs))
  })
}
thematic_shiny()
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

## Custom elements
For other elements than core shiny components like `numericInput()` or `{thematic}` compatible elements such as `plotOutput()`, `{bslib}` provides tools to design dynamically themeable custom components. 

Let's take the example of a simple card where the Sass code is defined below:

  - `.supercard` has a shadow, takes half of the page width and has a fixed height.
  Notice the `background-color` that takes the value of the `$primary` Sass variable,
  inherited from Bootstrap 4. 
  - `.supercard_body` adds padding to the card body content.

```scss
.supercard {
    box-shadow: 0 4px 10px 0 rgb(0, 0, 0), 0 4px 20px 0 rgb(0, 0, 0);
    width: 50%;
    height: 200px;
    background-color: $primary;
    
    .supercard_body {
      padding: 0.01em 16px;
    }
}
```

Below, for convenience, we put that Sass code inside a R string, even though best practice would
be to save it in a file and compile it with `sass_file()`. 

```{r}
sass_str <- "
  .supercard {
    box-shadow: 0 4px 10px 0 rgb(0, 0, 0), 0 4px 20px 0 rgb(0, 0, 0);
    width: 50%;
    height: 200px;
    
    background-color: $primary;
    .supercard_body {
      padding: 0.01em 16px;
    }
}"
```


If you try to run `sass(input = sass_str)`,
it will fail, as `$primary` is not defined. Now, the goal is to link this custom Sass code
to the main app theme, created with `bs_theme()`. We invoke the `bs_dependency()` function where:

  - __input__ refers to a list of Sass rules, that is `sass_str` in our example.
  - __theme__ is a theme generated with `bs_theme`.
  - __name__ and `version` are metadata.
  
In case we are not in a `{bslib}` context, ie the app does not pass a `bs_theme()` element,
we create a fallback containing the card CSS code:

```{r}
library(htmltools)
super_card_dependency <- function(theme) {
  
  dep_name <- "supercard"
  dep_version <- "1.0.0"
  
  if (is_bs_theme(theme)) {
    bs_dependency(
      input = sass_str,
      theme = theme,
      name = dep_name,
      version = dep_version
    )
  } else {
    htmlDependency(
      name = dep_name,
      version = dep_version,
      src = "supercard-1.0.0/css",
      stylesheet = "super-card.css",
      package = "OSUICode"
    )
  }
}
```

As shown, in Chapter \@ref(htmltools-dependencies), we have to add this dependency to the card
tag. Importantly, we wrap it inside `bs_dependency_defer()` that enables us to dynamically update the theme on the server
side, each time `session$setCurrentTheme` is called: 

```{r}
super_card <- function(...) {
  div(
    class = "supercard",
    div(class = "supercard_body", ...),
    bs_dependency_defer(super_card_dependency)
  )
}
```

We then create two simple theme, namely white and dark and run the app:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
white_theme <- bs_theme()
dark_theme <- white_theme %>% 
  bs_theme_update(bg = "black", fg = "white", primary = "orange")


ui <- fluidPage(
  theme = white_theme,
  theme_toggle(),
  br(),
  super_card("Hello World!")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  observeEvent(input$custom_mode, {
    session$setCurrentTheme(
      if (input$custom_mode) dark_theme else white_theme
    )
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

::: {.importantblock data-latex=""}
Live theming requires to pass the __session__ parameter to the server function. Don't forget it!
:::

The reader is invited to exploit the `run_with_themer()` capabilities, that allows
to dynamically modify the current theme, as shown Figure \@ref(fig:bslib-custom-component).

```{r bslib-custom-component, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='bs_theme_preview with custom component', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/beautify/bslib-custom-component.png")
```

Below, we try without passing any theme to `fluidPage()`, to test our CSS fall back strategy:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(super_card("Hello World!"))
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```
