# JavaScript for Shiny {#survival-kit-javascript}
To understand how Shiny works from inside, especially how inputs are handled, we'll gradually dive into its core which contains a substantial amount of JavaScript (JS).

::: {.warningbox data-latex=""}
This chapter is a very brief introduction to JS and jQuery but still necessary as this book is supposed to be standalone. Advanced JS users may skip this part. MDN web docs by Mozilla is an excellent [resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

## Shiny JavaScript sources

Image of shiny github 

Let's have a look at the `{shiny}` [@R-shiny] github [project](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny). As a R package, it is composed of standard folders like `R`, `man`, `tests` and other elements. The `inst` folder contains resources for external dependencies like [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [datatables](https://datatables.net/), [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/), ... mentioned in Chapter \@ref(web-dependencies) sorted in the `www/shared` sub-folder as well as the whole CSS and JS Shiny codes. Notice the presence of minified files like `shiny.min.js` and non minified elements such as `shiny.css`. Overall, the minification process reduces the loading time of a web page by removing comments, extra spaces, thereby decreasing the file size. For instance `shiny.js` has 6628 lines of code, while `shiny.min.js` has only 4.

Notice the `srcjs/` folder shown in Figure \@ref(fig:shiny-js-sources). It actually contains all pieces to reconstruct the whole `shiny.js` file.

```{r shiny-js-sources, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Shiny JavaScript sources', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/shiny-js-sources.png")
```


The `_start.js` and `_end.js` are used by the `Gruntfile.js`, that is a [grunt-based](https://gruntjs.com) tool to run different tasks such as concatenate multiple JavaScript files, lint the code, minify it ... See [here](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/tree/master/tools) for a summary.

```js
grunt.registerTask('default', [
  'concat',
  'string-replace',
  'validateStringReplace',
  'eslint',
  'configureBabel',
  'babel',
  'uglify'
]);
```

Since in Chapter \ref@(shiny-input-system) we'll use some of those script, a little understanding of the basic underlying JavaScript concepts is necessary.

## Introduction to JavaScript
JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich and is also known as ECMAScript (ES). Interestingly, you might have heard about ActionScript, which is no more than an implementation of ES by Adobe Systems. Nowadays, JavaScript is the centerpiece of web development across all websites. 

Here is a quick example. If you have a personal blog, you probably know [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) or [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), especially the R interfaces like [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) [@R-blogdown]. These tools allow one to rapidly develop a nice looking blog in just a few minutes, focusing on the content rather than technical aspects, which is really the point! Now, if you open the HTML inspector introduced in Chapter \@ref(web-intro-html), click on the elements tab, which may open by default, and uncollapse the `<head>` tag, you see that a lot of scripts are included, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:scripts-list). Similarly for the `<body>` tag.

```{r scripts-list, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='A website is full of JavaScript', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/scripts-list.png")
```

There are three ways to include scripts:

  - Use the `<script>` tag with the JS code inside
  - Add the `onclick` attribute to an HTML tag (preferably a button) to trigger JS as soon as it is clicked (This is similar to event listeners, see below)
  - Import an external file containing the JS code and only
  
```html
<script type="text/javascript">
// JS code here
</script>
```

```html
<button id="hello" onclick="jsFunction()">Hello World</button>
```

```html
<!-- We use the src attribute to link the external file -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="file.js">
```

Whether to choose the first, second or third method depends on the content of your script. If we consider the JS library jQuery, it unfortunately contains so much code making it a challenge to understand. This often makes users avoid the first method.

## Setup
Like [R](https://www.r-project.org/) or [Python](https://www.python.org/), JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted language. It is executed client-side, in other words in the browser. This also means that JS code may not be run without a suitable tool. In the following, we'll list some tools to test JS code, even though JS may also be run through the web browser developer tools, as demonstrated in section \@ref(shiny-js-inspector).

### Node {#install-node}
[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) contains an interpreter for JS as well as a dependencies manager, npm (Node Package Manager). To install Node on your computer, browse to the website and follow the installation instructions. Afterwards, open a terminal and check if

```
$ which node
$ node --version
```
returns something. If not, Node may not be properly [installed](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-install-and-use-node-js-and-npm-mac-and-windows/). 

::: {.noteblock data-latex=""}
If you prefer not installing Node, there exists alternatives like [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/nodejs), offering a Node.js online compiler environment. This will be more than enough to follow the exercises of this part.
:::

### Choose a good IDE
Personally, I really like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) for coding with JS, as it contains a Node interpreter allowing you to seamlessly execute any JS code. As a side note, I encourage you to try the dracula color theme, which is my favorite! As R user, I also like [Rstudio IDE](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), provided that you have Node installed. Below, we will explain how to run a JS code in both IDE's. In section \@ref(shiny-js-inspector), we will show how to manipulate JS code directly in the web browser, through the HTML inspector. This is the method we will mostly use in the remaining of the book since we will also work with HTML and CSS at the same time.  

### First Script
Let's write our first script:

```js
console.log("Hello World");
```

You notice that all instruction end by `;`. You can run this script either in Rstudio IDE or VSCode. 

```{r script-vscode, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Run JS in VSCode', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/script-vscode.png")
```

In VSCode, clicking on the run arrow (top center) of Figure \@ref(fig:script-vscode), triggers the `node hello.js` command, which tells Node to run the script. We see the result in the right panel (code=0 means the execution is fine and we even have the compute time). To run this script in the RStudio IDE, one needs to click on the terminal tab (you could also open a basic terminal) and type `node hello.js` (or `node mycustompath/hello.js` if you are not in the folder containing the script). You should see the Hello World message in the console (see Figure \@ref(fig:script-rstudio)).

```{r script-rstudio, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Run JS in a terminal', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/script-rstudio.png")
```

## Programming with JS: basis
We are now all set to introduce the basis of JS. As many languages, JS is made of variables and instructions. All instructions end by the `;` symbol.

### JS types
JS defines several types:

  - Number: does not distinguish between integers and others (in R for instance, numeric contains integers and double)
  - String: characters ('blabla')
  - Boolean: true/false
  
To check the type of an element, we may use the `typeof` operator.

```js
typeof 1; // number
typeof 'pouic'; // string
```

::: {.importantblock data-latex=""}
In JS, `typeof` is not a function like in R!!! Therefore don't write `typeof('string');`.
:::

### Variables

Variables are key elements to programming languages. They allow to store intermediate results and do other manipulations. In JS, a variable is defined by:

  - a type
  - a name
  - a value
  
::: {.importantblock data-latex=""}
A valid variable name:

  - Doesn't use a reserved JS name like `typeof`! 
  - Doesn't start with a number (123soleil)! 
  - Doesn't include any space (total price)!
:::

Besides, code style is a critical element in programming, increasing readability, and general consistence. There are several styles, the main ones being `snake_case` and `camelCase`. I personally use the `camelCase` syntax to write variables in JS. 

There are two ways to create variables in JavaScript.

#### Const
In JavaScript, a variable may be created with `const`:

```js
const n = 1;
n = 2; // error
const n = 3; // error
const a;
a = 1; // errors
```

As shown above, such variables:

  - Cannot be modified
  - Cannot share the same name
  - Must be assigned a value


#### let
Another way to define a variable:

```js
let myVariable = 'welcome';
myVariable = 1;
console.log(myVariable);
```

Then we may use all mathematical operators to manipulate our variables.

```js
let myNumber = 1; // affectation
myNumber--; // decrement
console.log(myNumber); // print 0
```

::: {.noteblock data-latex=""}
List of numerical operators in JS: 

  - `+`
  - `-`
  - `*`
  - `/`
  - `% (modulo)`
  - `++` (incrementation)
  - `--` (decrementation)
:::

::: {.noteblock data-latex=""}
To concatenate two strings, we use the`+` symbol. 
:::

You may also know `var` to declare variables. What is the difference with `let`? It is mainly a scope [reason](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_let.asp): 

```js
var i = 1;
{
  var i = 2; // this will modify i globally, not locally
}
console.log(`i is ${i}`); // i is 2.

let j = 1;
{
  let j = 2; // j is only declared locally and not globally!
}
console.log(`j is ${j}`); // j is 1
```

You will see later that we still use `var` in the shiny core and many other R packages. 

### Conditions
Below are the operators to check conditions.

::: {.noteblock data-latex=""}
  - `===` (A equal value, equal type B)
  - `==` (A equal to B)
  - `!==` (A not equal value or not equal type B)
  - `!=` (A not equal to B)
  - `>`, `>=`
  - `<`, `<=`
  - `AND` (A AND B) or `&&`
  - `OR` (A OR B) or `||`
:::

::: {.importantblock data-latex=""}
Importantly, prefer `===` and `!==` to compare elements since `5 == "5"` would return `true`, generally not what you want!
:::


To test conditions there exists several ways:

  - `if (condition) { console.log('Test passed'); }`
  - `if (condition) { instruction A} else { instruction B }`
  
The ternary operator is a shortcut `condition ? instruction if true : instruction if false` that may be chained. For complex instructions, we recommend not using it, as it may affect code readability.
  
Whenever a lot of possible conditions have to be evaluated, it is better to choose the `switch`.


```js
switch (variable) {
  case val1: // instruction 1
  break; // don't forget the break!
  case val2:  // instruction 2
  break;
  default: // when none of val1 and val2 are satisfied
}
```


### Objects
JavaScript is an object oriented programming language (like Python). An object is defined by:

  - a type
  - some properties
  - some methods (to manipulate properties)
  
Let's construct our first object:

```js
const me = {
  name : 'Divad',
  age : 29,
  music : '',
  printName: function() {
    console.log(`I am ${this.name}`);
  }
}

me.geek = true; // works (see const variables above)
console.log(JSON.stringify(me)); // print a human readable object.
  
console.log(me.name);
console.log(me.age);
console.log(me.music);
// don't repeat yourself!!!
for (let key in me) { // here is it ok to use `in`
 console.log(`me[${key}] is ${me[key]}`);
}

me.printName();

me = {
  name: 'Paul',
  age: 40
} // error (see const variables above)
```

Some comments on the above code:

  - To access an object property, we use `object.<propertiy_name>`.
  - To print a human readable version of the object, `JSON.stringify` will do the job.
  - We introduced string interpolation with `${*}`. `*` may be any valid expression.
  - Methods are accessed like properties (we may also pass parameters). We use `this` to refer to the object itself. Take note, we will see it a lot!
  
In JavaScript, there are already predefined objects to interact with arrays, dates.

#### Arrays
An array is a structure allowing to store information for instance:

```js
const table = [1, 'plop'];
table.push('hello');
table = [2]; // error (as explain in above in the variable part)
console.log(table);
```

Array may be nested:

```js
const nested = [1, ['a', [1, 2, 3]], 'plop'];
console.log(nested);
```

In arrays, elements may be accessed by their index, but as mentioned before, the first index is 0 (not 1 like in R). A convenient way to print all array's elements is to use an iteration:

```js
const nested = [1, ['a', [1, 2, 3]], 'plop'];
for (let i of nested) {
  console.log(i);
}

// or with the classic approach
for (let i = 0; i < nested.length; i++) {
  console.log(nested[i]);
}
```

Note that the `length` method returns the size of an array and is very convenient in for loops. Below is a table referencing the principal methods for arrays (we will use some of them later).

| Method/Property   |      Description     | 
|:----------:|:-------------:|
| length |  Return the number of elements in an array  | 
| Join(string separator) |  Transform an array in a string | 
| concat(array1, array2) |    Assemble 2 arrays   |  
| pop() | Remove the last element of an array |    
| shift() | Remove the first element of an array |
| unshift(el1, el2, ...) | Insert elements at the beginning of an array |
| push(el1, el2, ...) | Add extra elements at the end of an array |
| sort() | Sort array elements by increasing value of alphabetical order |
| reverse() | Symetric of sort() |

Quite honestly, we mainly use `push` and `length` in the next chapters.


#### Strings
Below are the main methods related to the String object (character in R).

| Method/Property/Operator   |     Description     | 
|:----------:|:-------------:|
| + (operator) |  String concatenation  | 
| length |  String length  | 
| indexOf() | Gives the position of the character following the input string |
| toLowerCase() | Put the string in small letters |
| toUpperCase() | Put the string in capital letters |


#### Math
Below we mention some useful methods to handle mathematical objects.

| Method   |     Description     | 
|:----------:|:-------------:|
| parseInt() |  Convert a string to integer  | 
| parseFloat() |  Conversion to floating number  | 

All classic functions like `sqrt`, trigonometric functions are of course available. We call them with the `Math.*` prefix.


### Iterations
Iterations allow to repeat an instruction or a set of instructions multiple times. Let's assume we have an array containing 100000 random numbers. How would you do to automatically print them? This a what we are going to see below!

#### For loops
The for loop has multiple uses. Below is a classic case where we start by defining the index (variable). We then set an upper bound  (the array length) and we finish by incrementing the index value. The code between curly braces is then executed.

```js
const table = [...Array(100).keys()]; // create an empty array of length 100 (so from 0 to 99, not from 1 to 100 like in R!!!)
for (let i = 0; i < table.length; i++) {
    console.log(table[i]); 
}
```

The way we created the array is a bit special and deserves some explanations: 

  - `Array` is a method to define a new array. We call it this way `Array(arrayLength)` since we don't want to write 100 values 1 by 1. But if you try `console.log(Array(10));` you will get `[ <10 empty items> ]`, meaning that 10 slots are available but nothing is inside yet.
  - `keys` defines keys for each table index. As a reminder, since `Array(10)` is an object (check with `console.log(typeof Array(10));`) we may use `Array(10).keys()`. This creates an Array Iterator.
  - `...` is a [spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax), and is called with an iterable object (see above).

::: {.importantblock data-latex=""}
Contrary to R, JavaScript index starts from 0 (not from 1)! This is good to keep in mind when we will mix both R and JS.
:::

Let's have a look at the `forEach` method for arrays (introduced in ES5):

```js
const letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
letters.forEach((letter) => {
  console.log(letter);
});
```

Below is another way to create a for loop (introduced in ES6):

```js
const samples = ['blabla', 1, null]; // this is an array!
for (let sample of samples) {
 console.log(sample);
}
```

What `for` loop should we use? The answer is: it depends on the situation! Actually, there even exists other ways (replace `of` by `in` and you get the indexes of the array, like with the first code, but this is really [not recommended](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/04/es6-in-depth-iterators-and-the-for-of-loop/)).


#### Other iterations: while
While loops are another way to iterate, as long as the condition defined is TRUE. The incrementation step is done at the end of the instruction. 

```js
const h = 3; i = 0;
while (i <= h) {
  console.log(i);
  i++; // we need to increment to avoid infinite loop
}
```

### Functions
Functions are useful to wrap a succession of instructions to accomplish a given task. Defining functions allows programmers to save time (less copy and paste, less search and replace), make less errors and easily share code. In modern JavaScript (ES6), functions are defined as follows:

```js
const a = 1;
const fun = (parm1, parm2) => {
  console.log(a);
  let p = 3;
  return Math.max(parm1, parm2); // I use the Math object that contains the max method
}
let res = fun(1, 2);
console.log(res); // prints a and 2. a global
console.log(p); // fails because p was defined inside the function
```

This above functions computes the maximum of 2 provided numbers. Some comments about scoping rules: variables defined inside the function are available for the function, but are not available outside the function definition. It should be noted that functions may use global variables defined outside of it.

#### Export functions: about modules {#about-js-modules}
What happens if you wrote 100 functions that you want to reuse in different scripts? To prevent copying and pasting, we will now introduce the concept of modules. Let's save the below function in a script `utils.js`:

```js
const findMax = (parm1, parm2) => {
  return Math.max(parm1, parm2); // I use the Math object that contains the max method
}

module.exports = {
  findMax : findMax
}
```

We create a `test.js` script in the same folder that calls the `findMax` function. To do this, we import the corresponding module:

```js
const {findMax} = require('./utils.js');
findMax(1, 2); // prints 2
```

### Event listeners
When you explore a web application, clicking on a button usually triggers something like a computation, a modal or an alert. How does this work? In JavaScript, interactivity plays a critical role. Indeed, you want the web application to react to user inputs like mouse clicks or keyboard events. Below we introduce DOM events.

Let's consider a basic HTML button.

```html
<button id="mybutton">Go!</button>
```

On the JavaScript side, we first capture the button element using its id selector (`getElementById`).

```js
const btn = document.getElementById('mybutton');
```

We then apply the `addEventListener` method. In short, an event listener is a program that triggers when a given event occurs (we can add multiple event listeners per HTML element). It takes 2 main parameters:

  - the event: click, change, mouseover, ...
  - the function to call
  
```js
btn.addEventListener('click', function() {
  alert('Thanks!');
});
```

::: {.noteblock data-latex=""}
We could compare the JavaScript events to Shiny `observeEvent` in which we are listening to a specific user input:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
observeEvent(trigger, {
  # instructions
})
```
:::


## jQuery

### Introduction
[jQuery](https://jquery.com) is a famous JavaScript library providing a user friendly interface to manipulate the DOM and is present in almost all actual websites. It is slightly easier (understand more convenient to use) than vanilla JS, even though web developers tend to avoid it to go back to vanilla JS (Bootstrap 5, the next iteration of Bootstrap will not rely on jQuery anymore). To use jQuery in a web page, we must include its code either by downloading the code and putting the minified JS file in our HTML or setting a link to a CDN: 

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Including jQuery</title>
    <!-- How to include jQuery -->
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.0.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
   
    <p>Hello World</p>
  
  <script>
    $('p').css('color', 'red');
  </script>
   
  </body>
</html>
```

### Syntax
Below is a minimal jQuery code representing its philosophy ("write less, do more."):

```js
$(selector).action();
```
The selector slot stands for any jQuery selector like class, id, element, [attribute], :input (will select all input elements) and many [more](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ref_selectors.asp). As a reminder, let's consider the following example:

```html
<p class="text">Hello World</p>
```

To select and interact with this element, we use JavaScript and jQuery:

```js
let inner = document.getElementsByClassName('text').innerHTML; // vanilla JS
let inner = $('.text').html(); // jQuery
```

This is of course possible to chain selectors:

```html
<ul class="list">
  <li class="item">1</li>
  <li class="item">2</li>
  <li class="item">3</li>
  <li class="item" id="precious-item">4</li>
</ul>

<ul class="list" id="list2">
  <li class="item">1</li>
  <li class="item">2</li>
  <li class="item">3</li>
  <li class="item">4</li>
</ul>
```

```js
let items = $('.list .item'); // will return an array containing 8 li tags
let otherItems = $('#list2 .item'); // will select only li tags from the second ul element
let lists = $('ul'); // will return an array with 2 ul elements
let firstItem = $('#list2:first-child'); // will return the first li element of the second ul.
```

### Useful functions
There exist filtering functions dedicated to simplify item [selection](https://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/). Below are is a list containing the mostly used in Shiny.

#### Travel in the DOM

| Method   |     Description     | 
|:----------:|:-------------:|
| children() | Get the children of each element passed in the selector (important: only travels a single level down the DOM tree) |
| first() | Given an list of elements, select the first item | 
| last() | Given an list of elements, select the last item |
| find() | Look for a descendant of the selected element(s) that could be multiple levels down in the DOM |
| closest() | Returns the first ancestor matching the condition (travels up in the DOM) |
| filter() | Fine tune element selection by applying a filter. Only return element for which the condition is true |
| siblings() | Get all siblings of the selected element(s) |
| next() | Get the immediately following sibling |
| prev() | Get the immediately preceding sibling |
| not() | Given an existing set of selected elements, remove element(s) that match the given condition | 


#### Manipulate tags
Below is a list of the main jQuery [methods](https://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/) to manipulate tags (adding class, css property...)

| Method   |     Description     | 
|:----------:|:-------------:|
| addClass() | Add class or multiple classes to the set of matched elements |
| hasClass() | Check if the matched element(s) have a given class |
| removeClass() | Remove class or multiple classes to the set of matched elements |
| attr() | Get or set the value of a specific attribute |
| after() | Insert content after |
| before () | Insert content before |
| css() | Get or set a css property | 
| remove() | Remove element(s) from the DOM |
| val() | Get the current value of the matched element(s) |

TO DO: add more methods

### Chaining jQuery methods
A lot of jQuery methods may be chained, that is like pipe operations in R.

```html
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
  <li>Item 4</li>
  <li>Item 5</li>
</ul>
```

We end the chain by `;` and each step is indented by 2 spaces in the right direction:

```js
$('ul')
  .first()
  .css('color', 'green') // add some style with css
  .attr('id', 'myAwesomeItem') // add an id attribute
  .addClass('amazing-ul');
```

### Iterations
Like in vanilla JavaScript, it is possible to do iterations in jQuery. Let's consider the following HTML elements:

```html
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```

We apply the `each` method to change the style of each matched element step by step:

```js
$('li').each(function() {
  $(this).css('visibility', 'hidden'); // will hide all li items
});
```

::: {.noteblock data-latex=""}
Notice that the following code `$('li').css('visibility', 'hidden');` will do exactly the same! This is explained by the implicit iteration process handled by most of jQuery methods.
:::

The `map` methods has a different purpose. It creates a new object based on the provided one. 

```js
const items = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const threshold = 3;

let filteredItems = $.map(items, function(i) {
  // removes all items > threshold
  if (i > threshold) 
    return null;
  return i;
});
```

### Good practice
It is recommended to wrap any jQuery code as follows:

```js
$(document).ready(function(){
  // your code
});

// or a shortcut

$(function() {
  // your code
});
```

::: {.importantblock data-latex=""}
Indeed, do you guess what would happen if you try to modify an element that does not even exist? The code above will make sure that the document is ready before starting any jQuery manipulation.
:::


### Events
In jQuery there exists a significant number methods related to events. Below are the most popular:

```js
$(element).click(); // click event
$(element).change(); // trigger change on an element
$(element).on('click', function() {
 // whatever
}); // attach an event handler function. Here we add click for the example
$(element).one('click', function() {
 // whatever
}); // the difference with on is that one will trigger only once
$(element).resize(); // useful to trigger plot resize in Shiny so that they correctly fit their container
$(element).trigger('change') // similar to $(element).change(); You will find it in the Shiny core.
```

The `.on` event is frequently used in Shiny since it allows to pass custom events which are not part of the JS predefined events. For instance `{shinydashboard}` [@R-shinydashboard] relies on a specific HTML/JavaScript/CSS template including a homemade API for handling the dashboard events. Don't worry if this section is not clear at the moment. We will see practical examples in the following chapters.


### Extending objects
A last feature we need to mention about jQuery is the ability to extend objects with additional properties and/or method. 

```js
// jQuery way
$(function() {
  let object1 = { apple: 0 };
  $.extend(object1, {
    print: function() {
      console.log(this);
    }
  });
  object1.print();
});
```

With vanilla JS we would use `Object.defineProperty`:

```js
// pure JavaScript
Object.defineProperty(object1, 'print', {
  value: function() {
    console.log(this);
  },
  writable: false
});
```


## Shiny, JavaScript and the HTML inspector {#shiny-js-inspector}
In the above part we gave some elementary JS knowledge. This section comes back to the main point of this book, that is Shiny. We describe how to leverage the developer tools so as to test,run and debug JavaScript code related to a Shiny app.

### The console panel
While developing JS code, we often put some `console.log(var)` calls to track the content of a given variable and check that our code is doing what it is supposed to do. The resulting messages, errors or warnings are printing in the console, also called a Read-eval-print loop (REPL) suitable to experiment and practice your new JS/jQuery skills.

#### A real REPL
As a warm up, run the shiny app below and open the Chrome DevTools. Notice the 2 `Console` tabs (next to `Elements` and at the bottom), as depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:dom-console). I prefer using the bottom one to still see the `Elements` tab and preview DOM modifications in real time.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage()

server <- function(input, output, session) {}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

```{r dom-console, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Console panel in the DevTools', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/dom-console.png")
```  

Interestingly, you may access any element contained in the window. Copy and paste `$("body").addClass("plop");` in the prompt. Notice what happens in the `Elements` tab.

#### Track errors and warnings
As discussed earlier in the book, a lot of Shiny app issues on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or in the [RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/) could be more easily solved by quickly inspecting the console.



### Debug Shiny/JS code with the inspector {#broken-shiny-app-debug}
To debug Shiny apps from the inspector, you all your scripts have to be in a folder accessible by the app like the `www/` folder or by using `shiny::addResourcePath`. Moreover,
if you have minified files, there must be [source maps](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/), which will allow to reconstruct the original scripts, that is as they were before the minification process. For instance, Shiny has the `shiny.min.js.map`. In practice, most R packages bundling HTML templates do not ship these files since they could be quite large (see package size restriction for CRAN). The [framework7](https://framework7.io/) HTML template, on top of which is built `{shinyMobile}` [R-shinyMobile] has source maps but the size can reach 5MB which is obviously too big to include in the R package.

In the following, we consider a very simple shiny app deployed on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/), where a notification is displayed with JavaScript as soon as a user clicks an action button. I also made some typos in my code and the goal is to find and fix them.

  1. Browse to the [app](https://dgranjon.shinyapps.io/debug_app_in_web_browser/)
  2. Open the Chrome DevTools
  3. Click on the action button (I am pretty sure you clicked before step 2 ;))
  4. As expected and shown Figure \@ref(fig:dom-debug-shiny-error), the console displays an
  error message: `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'show' of undefined`. Sounds good isn't it?
  
```{r dom-debug-shiny-error, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Error in the console panel', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/dom-debug-shiny-error.png")
```  
  
  5. Expand the error message to show the stack trace. We see that the error occurred during an `onclick` event calling the `sendNotif` function. Interestingly, we can open this file by clicking on the provided link (notif.js:2). You should get a layout similar to Figure \@ref(fig:dom-debug-shiny-sources), depending on your screen width.
  

```{r dom-debug-shiny-sources, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Inspect the source causing the error', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/dom-debug-shiny-sources.png")
```
  
  6. Let's briefly describe Figure \@ref(fig:dom-debug-shiny-sources). On the left side, you can navigate through all files accessible by the web server, that is shiny internal resources, shiny external dependencies (like Bootstrap 3) as well as your own scripts. If the app is deployed on shinyapps.io, all scripts are located in a folder starting by `_w_`, which corresponds to the shinyapps.io workerId (this is a detail and not important to understand. See more [here](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/blob/master/R/shiny.R#L69)). The central part contains any opened script like a classic IDE. The right side displays debugging tools which you may trigger by clicking on the corresponding accordion. The scope shows all variables/object values at a break point, watch allows to track specific elements and Event listener Breakpoints allows to stop at given listener type. We could create a new "watcher" by entering `typeof message` and clicking the add icon to check the message type within the `sendNotif` function. Watched expressions are saved when you close the browser. 
  
  7. Put a break point line 2 by clicking on the left side of the center panel and click again on the action button to trigger the break point. I also additionally set 2 Watch Expressions (for message and duration) which type is string and number, respectively, as depicted on Figure \@ref(fig:dom-debug-shiny-breakpoint). According to the results, nothing seems wrong for the function arguments.

```{r dom-debug-shiny-breakpoint, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Inspection of the scope at the breakpoint', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/dom-debug-shiny-breakpoint.png")
```

  8. The error message `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'show' of undefined` actually means that `notification` does not exist. Try yourself by typing `Shiny.notification` in the console. You'll get `undefined`. Instead, the console suggests
`Shiny.notifications`. Let's replace the wrong code in the `notif.js` script and then save it.
Click on the "Resume script execution" blue button (top left of the right panel). Notice that a notification is displayed and no more error is thrown.

Congrats! You've just debugged your first shiny app from the web inspector. In practice, your code is probably much more complex than this example but the workflow remains the same.

## Exercises

Because the JavaScript console is a REPL, all JavaScript exercises may be done inside, except exercise 3 which also involves HTML. In that case, the reader may browse to [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).

### Exercise 1: define variables 

1. Play with the example below

```{js}
let myNumber = 1; // affectation
myNumber--; // decrement
console.log(myNumber); // print 0
```

### Exercise 2: define objects 

Below is an object skeleton.

```{js}
const me = {
  name : ,
  age : ,
  music : ,
  printName: function() {
    console.log(`I am ${}`);
  }
}
```

1. Fill it with some random values.
2. Access the name property.
3. Create the printAge method, which returns the age. Hint: `this` refers to the object itself. For instance `this.name` gives the name property.

### Exercise 3: jQuery
[JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) allows to insert HTML, CSS and JavaScript to test
code, share and more. It also does not require you to have any specific configuration on your machine so that you focus on testing!

1. Go to [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/)
2. Insert the following HTML code chunk in the HTML sub-window.

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
  <!-- head content here -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <ul>
      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 2</li>
      <li>Item 3</li>
      <li>Item 4</li>
      <li>Item 5</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

This is a very basic HTML skeleton

3. In the JavaScript windows, select jQuery 3.4.1 in the dropdown menu (why 3.4.1? The latest Shiny release relies on that version. It is therefore best practice to ensure dependencies are similar, at least the major version). 
4. Since it is best practice to run jQuery code only when the document is ready (avoiding to target non existing elements), we wrap our JS code in the following:

```js
$(function() {
  // your code
});

// or a more explicit syntax
$(document).ready(function() {
  // code
});
```

5. Create an event listener to change the third item color as soon as one click on it. 
Hint 1: To select the a specific item you may use `$(selector:eq(i))` where i is the index of the element. Keep in mind that JavaScript starts from 0 and not 1 like R!
Hint 2: as a reminder, to create an event listener in jQuery, we use the following pattern.

```js
$("selector").on("event_name", function(e) {
  // your logic
});
```


### Exercise 4: a pure JS action button

Below is another example of a button element with an attached event listener. Clicking on the button will increment its value by 1. Fill in the blanks!

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
  <!-- head content here -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <button>click</button>
  </body>
</html>
```


```js
$(function() {
	
  // recover the button inner html
  const btnText = ...;

	// event listener for button element
	$(...).click(function() {
  	var val = ...;
    // (1) increment button 
    // (2) add the button value to the inner text
    ...
    
    // show alert given condition
    if (val > 3) {
      // do whatever you want
    	...
    }
  });
  
});
```
