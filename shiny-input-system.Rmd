# Shiny's input system {#shiny-input-system}
Shiny inputs are key elements of Shiny apps since they are a way for the end-user to interact with the app. You may know `sliderInput`, `numericInput`, `checkboxInput` but sometimes you may need fancier elements like `knobInput` from [shinyWidgets](https://github.com/dreamRs/shinyWidgets/blob/master/R/input-knob.R), as depicted on Figure \@ref(fig:fancy-inputs) or even more sophisticated inputs like the `smartSelect` of [shinyMobile](https://github.com/RinteRface/shinyMobile/blob/master/R/f7-inputs.R) (Figure \@ref(fig:fancy-inputs), right panel). Have you ever wondered what are the mechanisms behind inputs? Have you ever dreamt to develop your own?

The goal of this section is to understand how Shiny inputs work and how to create new ones.

```{r fancy-inputs, echo=FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "50%", fig.align = "default", fig.cap='Custom shiny inputs. left: knobInput from shinyWidgets; right: smart select from shinyMobile'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/jquery-knobs.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/smart-select.png")
```

## Input bindings

When we run our app, most of the time it works just fine! The question is, how are the inputs (and outputs) handled to allow this to happen? Upon initialization, Shiny runs several JavaScript functions. Some are accessible to the programmer (see a usecase [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51633326/dateinput-not-working-on-dt-in-shiny)). To illustrate what they do, let's run the app below.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
ui <- fluidPage(
  sliderInput("obs", "Number of observations:",
              min = 0, max = 1000, value = 500
  ),
  plotOutput("distPlot")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    hist(rnorm(input$obs))
  })
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

We then open the HTML inspector and run `Shiny.unbindAll(document)` (document is the scope, that is where to search). Try to change the slider input. You will notice that nothing happens. Now let's type `Shiny.bindAll(document)` and update the slider value. Moving the slider successfully update the plot. Magic isn't it? This simply shows that when inputs are not bound, nothing happens so binding inputs is necessary. 

We consider another example with multiple inputs.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  actionButton("unbind", "Unbind inputs", onclick = "Shiny.unbindAll();"),
  actionButton("bind", "Bind inputs", onclick = "Shiny.bindAll();"),
  lapply(1:3, function(i) {
    textInput(paste0("text_", i), paste("Text", i))
  }),
  lapply(1:3, function(i) {
    uiOutput(paste0("val_", i))
  })
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  lapply(1:3, function(i) {
    output[[paste0("val_", i)]] <- renderPrint(input[[paste0("text_", i)]])
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Let's see below what is an input binding and how it works.

### Input structure
An input element is given by the `<input>` tag as well as several attributes.

```html
<input id = inputId type = "text" class = "input-text" value = value>
```

  - __id__ guarantees the input uniqueness and a way for shiny to recover it in the `input$<id>` element. 
  - [type](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_type.asp) like `checkbox`, `button`,
  `text` ...__type__ may also be a good target for the input binding find method, as explained below. 
  - __class__ may be required to find the element in the DOM. It is more convenient for
  an input binding to target a class (and all associated elements) rather than an id which corresponds to one element by definition. 
  It is also used by CSS to apply styles.
  - __value__ holds the input value.

### Binding Shiny inputs
An input binding allows Shiny to identify each instance of a given input and what you may do with this input. For instance, a slider input must update whenever the range is dragged or when the left and right arrows of the keyboard are pressed. It relies on a class defined in the `input_binding.js` [file](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/blob/master/srcjs/input_binding.js). 

Let's describe each method chronologically. For better convenience, the book side package contains step by step demonstrations which may be found [here](https://github.com/DivadNojnarg/outstanding-shiny-ui-code/blob/master/R/inputs.R). Each example is called by the `customTextInputExample`, which takes the input binding step as only parameter. For instance `customTextInputExample(1)` will invoke the first step.

#### Find the input
The first step, is critical which is to locate the input in the DOM. On the R side, we define an input, with a specific attribute that will serve as a receptor for the binding. For most of inputs, this may be handled by the type attribute. In other cases, this may be the class, like for the `actionButton`. On the JS side, we need a method that will identify this receptor. Moreover, two different types of inputs (for instance `radioButton` and `selectInput`) cannot have the same receptor for conflict reasons, whereas two instances of the same input type can. If your app contains 10 sliders, they all share the same input binding, and this is where the thing is powerful since they are all bound in one step. The receptor identifier is provided by the `find` method of the `InputBinding` class. This method must be applied on a scope, that is the `document`.  `find` accepts any valid jQuery selector. Note the `console.log` only here for debugging purpose.

```js
find: function(scope) {
  console.log($(scope).find('.input-text'));
  return $(scope).find('.input-text');
}
```

Figure \@ref(fig:shiny-find-inputs) summarizes this important step.

```{r shiny-find-inputs, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='How to find inputs?', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/shiny-find-inputs.png")
```

Below, we are going to create a new binding for the `textInput`, with only two methods mentioned in the previous section, that is `find` and `getValue`. For that, we need to create a customized text input, `customTextInput` to make it unique. We now add the `input-text` class and make our own input binding pointing to that specific class.

```{r}
customTextInput <- function (inputId, label, value = "", width = NULL, placeholder = NULL) {
  
  # this external wrapper ensure to control the input width
  div(
    class = "form-group shiny-input-container", 
    style = if (!is.null(width)) {
      paste0("width: ", validateCssUnit(width), ";")
    },
    # input label
    shinyInputLabel(inputId, label), 
    
    # input element + JS dependencies
    tagList(
      customTextInputDeps(),
      tags$input(
        id = inputId,
        type = "text",
        class = "form-control input-text",
        value = value,
        placeholder = placeholder
      )
    )
  )
}
```

The last part of the code contains a `tagList` with two elements:

  - The element input binding
  - The input tag
  
Below is an example of how we managed the dependency creation in our side package.
Considering multiple inputs, we will add more script to the dependency by passing a vector to the script parameter. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
customTextInputDeps <- function() {
  htmlDependency(
    name = "customTextBindings",
    version = "1.0.0",
    src = c(file = system.file("chapter5/input-bindings", package = "OSUICode")),
    script = "customTextInputBinding.js"
  )
}
```

In the [shinyMobile](https://github.com/RinteRface/shinyMobile/tree/master/inst/framework7-5.5.0) package, we chose a more robust approach. All bindings are contained in a folder and compressed so that we generate only one minified file containing all collapsed bindings. 

Figure \@ref(fig:text-input) shows the main elements of the `textInput` widget. In the above code, `shinyInputLabel` is a Shiny internal function that creates the numeric input label, or in other word the text displayed next to it. The core input element is wrapped by `tags$input`. No worry if the structure seems unclear, we will give more details about shiny tags in the Chapter \@ref(htmltools-overview).

```{r text-input, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Shiny\'s textInput elements', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/text-input.png")
```

We invite the reader to run the full working demonstration with `customTextInputExample(1)`.
In short this example consists in a simple text input and an output showing the current text input value:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
customTextInputExample <- function(binding_step) {
  ui <- fluidPage(
    customTextInput(
      inputId = "caption",
      label = "Caption",
      value = "Data Summary",
      binding_step = binding_step
    ),
    textOutput("custom_text")
  )
  server <- function(input, output) {
    output$custom_text <- renderText(input$caption)
  }
  shinyApp(ui, server)
}
```

We open the developer tools to inspect the `customTextInputBinding.js` script, put a breakpoints in the `find` method and reload the page. Upon reload, the JavaScript debugger opens, as shown Figure \@ref(fig:binding-find). Type `$(scope).find('.input-text')` in the console and see what is displayed. This is the DOM element which you may highlight when you hover over the JavaScript output. 

Building input bindings like this significantly ease the debugging process and you'll get more chances to be successful!

```{r binding-find, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Find is the first method triggered', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/binding-find.png")
```

Now, let's see why it is better to target elements by type or class. We run the `customTextInputExampleBis()` example. This is a demonstration app containing two text inputs. Moreover, the binding has been modified so that it looks for element having a specific id:

```js
find: function(scope) {
  return $(scope).find('#mytextInput');
}
```

If you repeat the above debugging steps, `$(scope).find('.input-text')` only targets the 
first text input, meaning that the second input will not be found and bound. 

```{r binding-find-by-id, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Find by id is a rather bad idea', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/binding-find-by-id.png")
```

As a side note, you'll also get an error in the binding `Uncaught Not implemented`, indicating that the `getValue` method is not implemented yet. Fear not! We are going to 
add it very soon. 

#### Initialize inputs
Upon initialization, Shiny calls the `initializeInputs` function that takes all input bindings and call their `initialize` method before binding all inputs. Note that once an input has been initialized it has a `_shiny_initialized` tag to avoid initializing it twice. The initialize method is not always defined but some elements require to be explicitly initialized or activated. For instance the  [Framework7](https://framework7.io) API, on top of which [shinyMobile](https://github.com/RinteRface/shinyMobile) is built, require to instantiate all elements. Below is an example for the [toggle](https://framework7.io/docs/toggle.html) input:

```js
// what is expected
let toggle = app.toggle.create({
  el: '.toggle',
  on: {
    change: function () {
      console.log('Toggle changed')
    }
  }
});
```

`el: '.toggle'` means that we are looking at the element(s) having the `toggle` class. `app.toggle.create` is internal to the Framework7 API. The corresponding shinyMobile input binding starts as follows. 

```js
var f7ToggleBinding = new Shiny.InputBinding();
  $.extend(f7ToggleBinding, {
    initialize: function(el) {
      app.toggle.create({el: el});
    },
    // other methods
});
```

Once initialized, we may use all specific methods provided by the API. [Framework7](https://framework7.io) is clearly a gold mine, as its API provides many possible options for many inputs / widgets. 

#### Get the value
`getValue(el)` returns the input value. The way to obtain the value is different for almost all inputs. For instance, the `textInput` is pretty simple since the value is located in the `value` attribute. `el` refers to the element holding the id attribute and recognized by the `find` method. Figure \@ref(fig:shiny-el) shows the result of a `console.log($(el));`.

```{r shiny-el, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='About el', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/shiny-el.png")
```

```js
getValue: function(el) {
  console.log($(el));
  return $(el).val();
}
```

To get the value, we apply the jQuery method `val` on the `$(el)` element and return the result.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
customTextInputExample(2)
```

This time, the input value is returned. Notice that when you try to change the text content, the output value does not update as we would normally expect. We are actually missing a couple of methods so that the binding is fully working. We will introduce them in the following sections!

Similarly as in the find section, we run `customTextInputExample(2)` and open the developer tools to inspect the `customTextInputBinding.js` script. We put a breakpoints in the `getValue` method and reload the page. Upon reload, the JavaScript debugger opens starts in `find`. You may click on the next blue arrow to jump to the next breakpoints that is `getValue`, as shown Figure \@ref(fig:binding-getValue). Typing `$(el).val()` in the console shows the current 
text value.

```{r binding-getValue, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='getValue', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/binding-getValue.png")
```

Clicking on next again exists the debugger. Interestingly, you'll notice that a text appears a the bottom of our input, meaning that the `input$caption` element exists and 
is internally tracked by shiny. 

#### Set and update 
`setValue(el, value)` is used to set the value of the current input. This method is necessary so that the input value may be updated. It has to be used in combination with `receiveMessage(el, data)`, which is the JavaScript part of all the R `updateInput` functions. We usually call the `setValue` method inside.

```js
setValue: function(el, value) {
  $(el).val(value);
}
```

Let's create a function to update our custom text input. Call it `updateCustomTextInput`. It requires at least 3 parameters:

- inputId tells which input to update.
- value is the new value. This will be taken by the `setValue ` JS method in the input binding
- session is the Shiny session object mentioned earlier. We will use the `sendInputMessage` to send values from R to JavaScript. The `receiveMessage` method will apply `setValue` with the data received from R.

```{r}
updateCustomTextInput <- function(inputId, value = NULL, session = getDefaultReactiveDomain()) {
  session$sendInputMessage(inputId, message = value)
}
```

We add `setValue` and `receiveMessage` to custom input binding.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
updateCustomTextInputExample(3)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:shiny-update-inputs) illustrates the main mechanisms.

```{r shiny-update-inputs, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Events following a click on the update button. This figure demonstrates how R and JS communicate, through the websocket.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/shiny-update-inputs.png")
```


If we have to pass multiple elements to update, we would have to change the `updateCustomTextInput` function such as:

```{r}
updateCustomTextInput <- function(inputId, value = NULL, placeholder = NULL, session = getDefaultReactiveDomain()) {
  message <- dropNulls(
    list(
      value = value,
      placeholder = placeholder
    )
  )
  session$sendInputMessage(inputId, message)
}
```

`dropNulls` is an internal function ensuring that the list does not contain NULL elements. We send a list from R, which is then serialized to a JSON object. In the `receiveMessage` method, properties like `value` may be accessed using the . notation:

```js
receiveMessage: function(el, data) {
  console.log(data);
  if (data.hasOwnProperty('value')) {
    this.setValue(el, data.value);
  }
  // other parameters to update...
}
```

Similarly as in the previous sections, we run `updateCustomTextInputExample(3)` and open the developer tools to inspect the `customTextInputBinding.js` script. We put a breakpoints in the `receiveMessage` and `setValue` methods and reload the page. Upon reload, the JavaScript debugger opens starts in `find`. You may click on the next blue arrow until you reach `receiveMessage`, as shown Figure \@ref(fig:binding-update). Inspecting the `data` object, it contains only one property namely the value. In practice, there may be more complex structure. As an exercise, you may change the `data.value` to whatever value you want.

```{r binding-receive, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Receive a message from R', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/binding-receive.png")
```

Click on the next arrow makes us jump in the next call that is `setValue`, where we can print the value to check whether it is correct. Running `$(el).val(value);` in the debugger console instantaneously update the DOM element with the new text, as shown on Figure \@ref(fig:binding-setValue).

```{r binding-setValue, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Set the new value', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/binding-setValue.png")
```

So far so good! We managed to update the text input value on the client. Yet, after clicking the button, the output value does not change. We are going to fix this missing step in the next section.

#### Subscribe
`subscribe(el, callback)` listens to events defining Shiny to update the input value and make it available in the app. Some API like Bootstrap explicitly mention those events (like `hide.bs.tab`, `shown.bs.tab`, ...).
Going back to our custom text input, what event would make it change?

- After a key is release on the keyboard. We may listen to `keyup`
- After copying and pasting any text in the input field or dictating text. The `input` event may be helpful

We may add those [events](https://javascript.info/events-change-input) to our binding using an event listener seen at the end of Chapter \@ref(survival-kit-javascript).

```js
$(el).on('keyup.customTextBinding input.customTextBinding', function(event) {
  callback(true);
});
```

`callback` ensures that the new value is captured by Shiny. We will come back later on the callback parameter, which is rather complex. 


```{r, eval=FALSE}
updateCustomTextInputExample(4)
```

We run the above example, open the HTML inspector, select the `customTextInputBinding_4.js` script and put a break point in the `getValue` as well as `subscribe` method. We enter a new text inside the input field, which triggers the debugger inside the `subscribe` call.
Inspecting the event object, the type indicate the action, which is an input action and the target is the text input element itself, depicted on Figure \@ref(fig:binding-subscribe-1).

```{r binding-subscribe-1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Subscribe method after a manual update of the text input', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/binding-subscribe-1.png")
```

We click on next and notice that we go back in the `getValue` method to get the new value.
You may check typing `$(el).val()` in the debugger console, like on Figure \@ref(fig:binding-subscribe-2). Clicking next again shows the updated output value.

```{r binding-subscribe-2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Subsribe is followed by a new getValue', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/binding-subscribe-2.png")
```

Hooray! The output result is successfully changed when the input value is manually updated. However, it is not modified when we click on the update button. What did we miss? Looking back at the `receiveMessage` method, we changed the input value but how does Shiny knows that this step was successful? To check that no event is raised, we put a `console.log(event);` in the `subscribe` method. Any action like removing the text content or adding new text triggers event but clicking on the action button does not. Therefore, we must trigger an event and add it to the `subscribe` method. We may choose the `change` event, that triggers when an element is updated. Notice the parameter passed to callback. We discuss it in the next part!

```js
$(el).on('change.customTextBinding', function(event) {
  callback(false);
});
```

Besides, in the `receiveMessage` we must trigger a `change` event to trigger the subscribe method:

```js
receiveMessage: function(el, data) {
  if (data.hasOwnProperty('value')) {
    this.setValue(el, data.value);
    $(el).trigger('change');
  }
}
```

Let's try again.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
updateCustomTextInputExample(5)
```

We put a new break point in the second event listener, that is the one for the change event. Clicking on the button only triggers the change event, as shown Figure \@ref(fig:binding-subscribe-3).

```{r binding-subscribe-3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Subsribe is followed by a new getValue', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/binding-subscribe-3.png")
```

Perfect? Not exactly. 

#### Setting rate policies
It would be better to only change the input value once the keyboard is completely released for some time (and not each time a key is released). This is what we call debouncing, which allows a delay before telling Shiny to read the new value, and is achieved using the `getRatePolicy` method. Additionally, we must also pass `true` to the `callback` in the subscribe method, in order to apply our specific rate policy ([debounce](https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function), throttle). This is useful for instance when we don't want to flood the server with useless update requests. For example when using a slider, we only want to send the value as soon as the range stops moving and not all intermediate values. Those elements are defined [here](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/blob/master/srcjs/input_rate.js).


Run the app below and try to manually change the text input value by adding a couple of letters as fast as you can. What do you notice? We see the output value only updates when we release the keyboard.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
customTextInputExample(6)
```

You may adjust the delay according to your needs, but we caution to not set the delay too long as this becomes problematic too. 

If you want to get an overview of all binding steps, you may try the following [slide](https://rinterface.com/shiny/talks/RPharma2020/?panelset1=r-code2#45) from the 2020 R in Pharma workshop.

#### Register an input binding
At the end of the input binding definition, we register it for Shiny.

```js
let myBinding = new Shiny.inputBinding();
  $.extend(myBinding, {
  // methods go here
});

Shiny.inputBindings.register(myBinding, 'reference');
```

Although the Shiny [documentation](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/building-inputs.html) mentions a `Shiny.inputBindings.setPriority` method to handle conflicting bindings, this case almost never happens.


#### Other binding methods
There are a couple of methods not described above that are contained in the `InputBinding` class prototype. They were not described before since most of the time, we don't need to change them and can rely on the defaults:

  - `getId` returns the object id (Figure \@ref(fig:binding-getId)). If you don't provide your own method, the binding falls back to the default one provided in the `InputBinding` class. This method is called after `find`. The next Chapter \@ref(shiny-input-lifecycle) provides more details. 
  - `getType` required to handle custom data format. It is called after `getId`. 
  - `getState` ?
  
```{r binding-getId, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Binding getid method', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/binding-getId.png")
```

### Edit an input binding {#edit-input-binding}
In some cases, we would like to access the input binding and change it's default behavior, even though not always recommended, since it will affect **all** related inputs. As bindings are contained in a registry, namely `Shiny.inputBindings`, one may seamlessly access and modify them. This is a 5 steps process:

1. Wait for the `shiny:connected` [event](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/js-events.html)
2. Unbind all inputs with `Shiny.unbindAll()`
3. Access the binding registry, `Shiny.inputBindings`
4. Extend the binding and edit its content with `$.extend(... {...})`
5. Apply the new changes with `Shiny.bindAll()`

```js
$(function() {
  $(document).on('shiny:connected', function(event) {
    Shiny.unbindAll();
    $.extend(Shiny
      .inputBindings
      .bindingNames['shiny.actionButtonInput']
      .binding, {
        // do whathever you want to edit existing methods
      });
    Shiny.bindAll();
  });
});
```

### Update a binding from the client
The interest of `receiveMessage` and `setValue` is to be able to update the input
from the server side, that is R, through the `session$sendInputMessage`. Yet, 
this task might be done directly on the client, thereby lowering the load on the server.
We consider the following example: a shiny app contains 2 actions buttons, clicking on the first one
increases the value of the second by 10. This won't be possible with the classic approach since a button click
only increases by 1. How do we proceed? 

1. We first set an event listener on the first button.
2. We target the second button and get the input binding with `$obj.data('shiny-input-binding')`
3. We recover the current value 
4. We call the `setValue` method of the input binding adding 10 to the current value
5. Importantly, to let Shiny update the value on the R side, we must trigger an event that will be detected in the `subscribe` method of the action button input binding. The action button only has 1 event listener but other may be added. Don't forget that triggering a `click` event would also increment the button value by 1! In the following we have to customize the `subscribe` method to work around

```js
$(function() {
  // each time we click on #test (a button)
  $('#button1').on('click', function() {
    var $obj = $('#button2');
    var inputBinding = $obj.data('shiny-input-binding');
    var val = $obj.data('val') || 0;
    inputBinding.setValue($obj, val + 10);
    $obj.trigger('event');
  });
});
```

If you click on the second button, the value increments only by 1 and the plot will be only visible after 10 clicks, while only 1 click is necessary on the first button. The reset button resets the second action button value to 0. It implements the feature discussed in the previous part, where we extend the button binding to add a `reset` method and edit the `subscribe` method to add a `change` event listener, simply telling shiny to get the new value. Contrary to `click`, `change` does not increment the button value.

```js
$.extend(Shiny.inputBindings.bindingNames['shiny.actionButtonInput'].binding, {
  reset: function(el) {
   $(el).data('val', 0);
  },
  subscribe: function(el, callback) {
    $(el).on('click.actionButtonInputBinding', function(e) {
      var $el = $(this);
      var val = $el.data('val') || 0;
      $el.data('val', val + 1);

      callback();
    });
            
    // this does not trigger any click and won't change the button value            
    $(el).on('change.actionButtonInputBinding', function(e) {
      callback();
    });
  }
});
```

Below is the working app.

```{r access-binding-outside, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$head(
    tags$script(
      "$(function() {
        $(document).on('shiny:connected', function(event) {
          Shiny.unbindAll();
          $.extend(Shiny
            .inputBindings
            .bindingNames['shiny.actionButtonInput']
            .binding, {
              reset: function(el) {
               $(el).data('val', 0);
              },

This trick has been extensively used in the [virtual physiology simulator](https://community.rstudio.com/t/shiny-contest-submission-a-virtual-lab-for-teaching-physiology/25348) to trigger [animations](https://dgranjon.shinyapps.io/entry_level/).

## Secondary inputs {#secondary-inputs}
The Shiny input binding system is too convenient to be only used for primary input elements like `textInput`, `numericInput`. It is a super powerful tool to unleash your apps's interactivity. 
In the following, we show how to add an input to an element that was not primarily designed to be a user input. 

### {shinydashboard} boxes on steroids
In {shinydashboard}, you may know the `box` function. Boxes are containers with a title, body, footer, as well as optional elements. It would be nice to capture the state of the box in an input, so as to trigger other actions as soon as this input changes. Since an input value is unique, we must add an `inputId` parameter to the box function. You may inspect the code [here](https://github.com/DivadNojnarg/outstanding-shiny-ui-code/blob/master/R/box2.R). 

Since we may collapse and uncollapse the box, we create the `updateBox2` function, which will toggle it:

```{r}
updateBox2 <- function(inputId, session = getDefaultReactiveDomain()) {
  session$sendInputMessage(inputId, message = NULL)
}
```

When collapsed, a box gets the `collapsed-box` class. Note: this will be useful for the input binding. As mentioned above, it is also necessary to know when to tell Shiny to update the value with the `subscribe` method. Most of the time, the change event might be sufficient, but as shinydashboard is built on top of [AdminLTE2](https://adminlte.io/docs/2.4/js-box-widget), it has an API to control the box behavior. We identify 2 events corresponding to the collapsible action: 
  
  - expanded.boxwidget (Triggered after the box is expanded)
  - collapsed.boxwidget (Triggered after the box is collapsed)
  
Unfortunately, after further investigations, those events are not possible to use since the AdminLTE code does not trigger them in the main JS [code](https://github.com/rstudio/shinydashboard/blob/master/srcjs/AdminLTE/app.js) (see the collapse method line 577-612). There are other solutions, as shown below with the `click` event. To toggle the box, we use the `toggleBox` method. 

```js
let boxBinding = new Shiny.InputBinding();
$.extend(boxBinding, {
  find: function(scope) {
    return $(scope).find('.box');
  },
  getValue: function(el) {
    let isCollapsed = $(el).hasClass('collapsed-box')
    return {collapsed: isCollapsed}; // this will be a list in R
  },
  setValue: function(el, value) {
    $(el).toggleBox();
  }, 
  receiveMessage: function(el, data) {
    this.setValue(el, data);
    $(el).trigger('change');
  },
  subscribe: function(el, callback) {
    $(el).on('click', '[data-widget="collapse"]', function(event) {
      setTimeout(function() {
        callback();
      }, 550);
    }); 
    
    $(el).on('change', function(event) {
      setTimeout(function() {
        callback();
      }, 550);
    });
  },
  unsubscribe: function(el) {
    $(el).off('.boxBinding');
  }
});

Shiny.inputBindings.register(boxBinding, 'box-input');
```

Some comments about the binding:

  - `getValue` returns an object which will give a list in R. This is in case we add other elements like the remove action available in AdminLTE
  - `setValue` calls the plug and play `toggleBox` method
  - `receiveMessage` must trigger a change event so that Shiny knows when the value needs to be updated
  - `subscribe` listens to the `click` event on the `[data-widget="collapse"]` element and delays the `callback` call by a value which is slightly higher than the default AdminLTE2 animation to collapse the box (500mx). If you omit this part, the input will not have time to properly update!!!
  - We don't need an extra listener for the `updateBox2` function since it also triggers a click on the collapse button, thereby forwarding to the corresponding listener

Let's try our new toy in a simple dashboard:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  # import shinydashboard deps without the need of the dashboard template
  useShinydashboard(),

  tags$style("body { background-color: ghostwhite};"),

  br(),
  box2(
   title = textOutput("box_state"),
   "Box body",
   inputId = "mybox",
   collapsible = TRUE,
   plotOutput("plot")
  ),
  actionButton("toggle_box", "Toggle Box", class = "bg-success")
 )

 server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    req(!input$mybox$collapsed)
    plot(rnorm(200))
  })

  output$box_state <- renderText({
    state <- if (input$mybox$collapsed) "collapsed" else "uncollapsed"
    paste("My box is", state)
  })

  observeEvent(input$toggle_box, {
    updateBox2("mybox")
  })

 }

 shinyApp(ui, server)
```


Even though animations are nice, it appears rather sub-optimal to wait 500 ms for a box to collapse. AdminLTE [options](https://adminlte.io/themes/AdminLTE/documentation/index.html#adminlte-options) allow to change this through the `$.AdminLTE.boxWidget` object. We specify the `animationSpeed` property to 10 milliseconds and update the input binding script to reduce the delay in the `subscribe` method (50 ms seems reasonable). To get a comparison try to run the example below.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# You'll need the devel version of shinydashboardPlus
#remotes::install_github("RinteRface/shinydashboardPlus")

library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)
library(shinydashboardPlus)
 
 ui <- dashboardPage(
   dashboardHeader(),
   dashboardSidebar(),
   dashboardBody(
     tags$style("body { background-color: ghostwhite}"),
     actionButton("toggle_box", "Toggle Box"),
     br(),
     box(
       title = textOutput("box_state"),
       "Box body",
       inputId = "mybox",
       collapsible = TRUE,
       closable = TRUE,
       plotOutput("plot")
     )
   )
 )
 
 server <- function(input, output, session) {
   output$plot <- renderPlot({
     req(!input$mybox$collapsed)
     plot(rnorm(200))
   })
   
   output$box_state <- renderText({
     state <- if (input$mybox$collapsed) "collapsed" else "uncollapsed"
     paste("My box is", state)
   })
   
   observeEvent(input$toggle_box, {
     updateBox("mybox", action = "toggle")
   })
   
   
   observeEvent(input$mybox$collapsed, {
     collapsed <- if (input$mybox$collapsed) "collapsed" else "uncollapsed"
     message <- paste("My box is", collapsed)
     showNotification(message, type = "warning", duration = 1)
   })
   
 }
 
 shinyApp(ui, server)

```

### Going further
We may imagine leveraging the input binding system to update any box property and get rid of the classic `renderUI` approach. Indeed, until now, there would be only one way to update a box from the server:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  # import shinydashboard deps without the need of the dashboard template
  useShinydashboard(),

  tags$style("body { background-color: ghostwhite};"),

  br(),
  uiOutput("custom_box"),
  selectInput("background", "Background", choices = shinydashboard:::validColors)
 )

 server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$custom_box <- renderUI({
    box2(
      title = "Box",
      "Box body",
      background = input$background
    )
  })
 }

 shinyApp(ui, server)
```

The whole piece of UI is re-rendered each time, while only the box class should be modified. This does not have much impact here but for a very complex app festooned with inputs/outputs, the overall user experience may be altered.

To do so, we proceed in 2 steps. The first part consists in customizing the `box` function to gather as many parameter as possible in an option list. For instance, we choose to extract background, width and title. width and background are expected to be numeric and character, respectively, while title might be any HTML tag, justifying the use of `as.character`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
box2 <- function(..., id = NULL, title = NULL, footer = NULL,
                 background = NULL, width = 6, height = NULL,
                 collapsible = FALSE, collapsed = FALSE) {
  
  props <- dropNulls(
    list(
      title = as.character(title),
      background = background,
      width = width
    )
  )
  
  # I removed some of the code to highlight that part
}
```

This properties list has to be treated on the JS side. Before, we must make it accessible within the `box2`
HTML tag. We choose the following approach, where we convert our properties to a JSON with `jsonlite::toJSON` and embed them in a script tag. Note the `data-for` attribute with the unique id parameter. This will guarantee the uniqueness of our configuration script.

```{r}
box2 <- function(..., id = NULL, title = NULL, footer = NULL,
                 background = NULL, width = 6, height = NULL,
                 collapsible = FALSE, collapsed = FALSE) {
  
  # code not shown
  
  boxTag <- shiny::tags$div(
    class = if (!is.null(width)) paste0("col-sm-", width), 
    shiny::tags$div(
      id = id,
      class = boxClass, 
      headerTag, 
      shiny::tags$div(
        class = "box-body", 
        style = style,
        ...,
        sidebar[c(1, 3)],
      ), 
      if (!is.null(footer)) shiny::tags$div(
        class = if (isTRUE(footerPadding)) "box-footer" else "box-footer no-padding", footer)
    ),
    
    # this will make our props accessible from JS
    shiny::tags$script(
      type = "application/json",
      `data-for` = id,
      jsonlite::toJSON(
        x = props,
        auto_unbox = TRUE,
        json_verbatim = TRUE
      )
    )
  )
  
  boxTag
  
}
```

Then, we have to update the `updateBox2` such that it handles both toggle and update possibilities. `options` contains all updatable properties like background, title and width.
We don't describe the toggle case since it is quite similar to the previous implementations. When the action is `update`, we enter the if statement and options must be processed. If the option element is a shiny tag or a list of shiny tag (`tagList`), we convert it to character. The returned message is a vector containing the action as well as the option list. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
updateBox2 <- function(id, action = c("toggle", "update"), options = NULL,
                      session = getDefaultReactiveDomain()) {
  # for update, we take a list of options
  if (action == "update") {
    # handle case whare options are shiny tag or a list of tags ...
    options <- lapply(options, function(o) {
      if (inherits(o, "shiny.tag") || inherits(o, "shiny.tag.list")) {
        o <- as.character(o)
      }
      o
    })
    message <- dropNulls(c(action = action, options = options))
    session$sendInputMessage(id, message)
  } else {
    session$sendInputMessage(id, message = action)
  }
}
```

On the JS side, we modify the `setValue` method to import our newly defined properties. The `boxTag` has two children, the box and the configuration script. `$(el)` refers to the box, therefore we have to look one level up to be able to use the `find` method (find always goes deeper in the DOM), namely `$(el).parent()`. From there, we only have to target the script tag `$(el).parent().find("script[data-for='" + el.id + "']")`. Once captured in a variable, we parse the corresponding element to convert it to an objects that we can manipulate: for instance `config.width` returns the initial width. `value.options.width` will contain the new width value provided in the `updateBox2` message output. Good practice is to check whether `value.options.width` exists with `value.options.hasOwnProperty("width")`. If yes we ensure whether its value and `config.width` are different. We always choose `===` which compares the type and the value (`==` only compares the value such that `"1" == 1` is `true`). We then call the internal method `_updateWidth` which is defined in the input binding. It has 3 parameters, el, o and n (o and n being the old and new values, respectively):

```js
_updateWidth: function(el, o, n) {
  // removes old class
  $(el).parent().toggleClass("col-sm-" + o);
  $(el).parent().addClass("col-sm-" + n); 
  // trigger resize so that output resize
  $(el).trigger('resize');
}
```

We must trigger a `resize` event so that output correctly scale. The internal method is identified by an underscore since it is not an inherited `Shiny.InputBinding` method. 

We finally update the config value by the newly set value and repeat the process for any other property.

```js
setValue: function(el, value) {
  var config = $(el).parent().find("script[data-for='" + el.id + "']");
  config = JSON.parse(config.html());
  
  // JS logic
  if (value.action === "update") {
    if (value.options.hasOwnProperty("width")) {
      if (value.options.width !== config.width) {
        this._updateWidth(el, config.width, value.options.width)
        config.width = value.options.width;
      }
    }
    // other items to update
    
    // replace the old JSON config by the new one to update the input value 
    $(el)
      .parent()
      .find("script[data-for='" + el.id + "']")
      .replaceWith(
        '<script type="application/json" data-for="' + 
        el.id + 
        '">' + 
        JSON.stringify(config) + 
        '</script>'
      );
    
  } else {
    // other tasks
  }
  
}
```

Don't forget to update the config script attached to the card tag at the end of the update
condition, otherwise the input value won't be updated:

```js
$(el)
  .parent()
  .find("script[data-for='" + el.id + "']")
  .replaceWith(
    '<script type="application/json" data-for="' + 
    el.id + 
    '">' + 
    JSON.stringify(config) + 
    '</script>'
  );
```

If it represents a significant amount of work, it is also the guarantee to lower the load on the server side.

Be careful with `this`. Indeed, called in an event listener, `this` refers to the element that triggered the event and not to the input binding object!

## Utilities to quickly define new inputs

### Introduction
If you ever wondered where the `Shiny.onInputChange` or `Shiny.setInputValue` comes from (see  [article](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/communicating-with-js.html)), it is actually defined in the `initShiny` function. 

```js
exports.setInputValue = exports.onInputChange = function(name, value, opts) {
  opts = addDefaultInputOpts(opts);
  inputs.setInput(name, value, opts);
};
```

Briefly, this function avoids creating an input binding. It is faster to code but there is a price to pay: losing the ability to easily update the new input. Indeed, all input functions like `sliderInput` have their own update function like `updateSliderInput`, because of the custom input binding system (We will see it very soon)!

### Examples
`Shiny.setInputValues` becomes powerful when combined to the numerous Shiny JavaScript events listed [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/js-events.html). This is what
we use in the [shinyMobile](https://rinterface.github.io/shinyMobile/articles/shinyMobile_tools.html) package to store the current device information in a shiny input.
Briefly, Framework7 (on top of which is built shinyMobile) has a method `Framework7.device`, which gives many [details](https://framework7.io/docs/device.html) related to the user device.

```js
$(document).on('shiny:connected', function(event) {
  Shiny.setInputValue('deviceInfo', Framework7.device);
});
```

This allows to conditionally display elements and deeply customize the interface.
In the example below, the card will not show on mobile devices. 

```{r, eval= FALSE}
library(shinyMobile)
shinyApp(
  ui = f7Page(
    title = "My app",
    f7SingleLayout(
      navbar = f7Navbar(
        title = "shinyMobile info",
        hairline = FALSE,
        shadow = TRUE
      ),
      # main content
      uiOutput("card"),
      verbatimTextOutput("info"),
    )
  ),
  server = function(input, output, session) {
    
    output$info <- renderPrint(input$shinyInfo)

    # generate a card only for desktop
    output$card <- renderUI({
      if (!input$deviceInfo$desktop) {
        f7Card(
          "This is a simple card with plain text,
          but cards can also contain their own header,
          footer, list view, image, or any other element."
        )
      } else {
        f7Toast(
          session, 
          "You are on desktop! The card will not display", 
          position = "center"
        )
      }
    })
  }
)
```

### Custom data format
In some cases, the automatic Shiny R to JS data management may not meet our needs. For instance, assume we create a date in JS with `new Date()` and store it in a shiny input with `Shiny.setInputValue`. On the R side, we will not obtain a date but a character, which is not convenient. This is where input handlers are useful since they allow to manipulate data generated on the JS side before injecting them in R. Such handlers are created with `shiny::registerInputHandler` that takes 2 parameters:

  - type allows to connect the handler to `Shiny.setInputValue`. Note that the id is followed by the handler type, for instance `Shiny.setInputValue('test:handler', ...)` is connected to `shiny::registerInputHandler('handler', ...)`
  - a function to transform data, having data as main parameter
  
Below I exceptionally include JS code directly in the shiny app snippet, which is not best practice but convenient for the demonstration. Only the second input will give the correct result.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# You must click on the window to create inputs!!
registerInputHandler("textDate", function(data, ...) {
  if (is.null(data)) {
    NULL
  } else {
    res <- try(as.Date(unlist(data)), silent = TRUE)
    if ("try-error" %in% class(res)) {
      warning("Failed to parse dates!")
      # as.Date(NA)
      data
    } else {
      res
    }
  }
}, force = TRUE)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$script(
    "$(function(){
      $(window).on('click', function() {
        var currentTime = new Date();
        Shiny.setInputValue('time1', currentTime);
        Shiny.setInputValue('time2:textDate', currentTime);
      });
    });
    "
  ),
  verbatimTextOutput("res1"),
  verbatimTextOutput("res2")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$res1 <- renderPrint(list(class(input$time1), input$time1))
  output$res2 <- renderPrint(list(class(input$time2), input$time2))
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```
