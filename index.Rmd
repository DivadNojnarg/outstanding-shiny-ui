# Prerequisites {-}

  - Be familiar with [Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org)
  - Basic knowledge in HTML and JavaScript is a plus but not mandatory

## Disclaimer {-}

This book is not an HTML/Javascript/CSS course! Instead, it provides a _survival kit_ to be able to customize Shiny. I am sure however that readers will want to explore more about these topics.

## Is this book for me? {-}

You should read this book if you answer yes to the following questions:

  - Do you want to know how to develop outstanding shiny apps?
  - Have you ever wondered how to develop new input widgets?

This book will serve as a reference for the e-Rum2020 [workshop](https://2020.erum.io/program/workshops/) about "Advanced User Interfaces for Shiny Developers", provided by [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com). The detailed agenda is available [here](https://github.com/Novartis/Advanced-User-Interfaces-for-Shiny-Developers).
