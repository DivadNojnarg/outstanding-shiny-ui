# R + Shiny + React: welcome `{reactR}` {#going-further-reactR}
[React](https://reactjs.org/) is an open source library designed to quickly develop user interfaces or UI components, on the __front end__. 
It has been developed by [Facebook](https://github.com/facebook/react) and the community (more than 1500 contributors) and made public in May 29 2013. It is currently used worldwide and has around 163k stars on the Github ranking and widely impacts the mobile market, through the [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) library. __React__ is also really convenient to develop attractive documentations with [docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/).
If you ever have built user interfaces with pure JS, you might like React! 

Below, we give a short introduction to the React ecosystem and see how we can benefit from it from the
R Shiny side. 

## Quick introduction to React
To understand React there are few prerequisites notably basic HTML/CSS/JS knowledge, especially JS modules (see section \@ref(about-js-modules)). However, if you managed to reach this chapter, you should not worry too much! 

### Setup
__Node__ and __npm__ are required. If you are not sure, run:

```shell
node -v
npm -v
```

At that stage it is also good to have [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable) as we'll need it for `{reactR}`.

If nothing is returned, please refer to section \@ref(install-node). To initiate a React [project](https://create-react-app.dev/), we leverage the [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npx) command:

```
npx create-react-app <PROJECT_NAME>
```

Replace `<PROJECT_NAME>` by the real name of your project. If this seems intimidating, 
keep in mind this is the same concept has using the `{golem}` [package](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem) to initiate the creation of robust shiny projects, except that we work from the terminal.

Once done (the package initialization takes some time), 
move to the project folder and launch the demo app:

```
cd <PROJECT_NAME> && npm start
```

If you have yarn, `yarn start` also works.

You should see something similar to Figure \@ref(fig:basic-react-app).

```{r basic-react-app, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='npm start opens the react app', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/going-further/basic-react-app.png")
```

Congrats! You are running your first React app!

### Basics
We are now all set up to start learning the basics of React. Among all created files,
notice the `/src/app.js` file. Inside the `App` function, we remove all the content inside
the `return` statement to put a simple `<h1>Hello, world!</h1>` HTML title. We also clean the imports
as we don't need any CSS and logo anymore. We obtain:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  );
}

// don't remove, this is needed by index.js
export default App; 
```

Once done, we run `npm build` (or `yarn build`), to rebuild the JS code and `npm start` to
restart the server and preview the app. In practice, once the server is launched, there is 
no need to restart it whenever the code is updated. A simple save will refresh the interface!

The code you see above is a React __component__. The definition is rather simple: it is a function that returns a moreless complex piece of UI. How are components rendered by React?

So far, we didn't have a look at the `/src/index.js` script. Inside we find:

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(
  App,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

::: {.noteblock data-latex=""}
Recent version of `npx create-react-app` have `<React.StrictMode><App /></React.StrictMode>` instead of `App`, which does the same thing. You may also find `<App />`. In practice, we rarely modify this part.
:::

In short, this inserts the `App` component inside the element having __root__ as id in the main
HTML page. This HTML skeleton may be found in the `public/index.html` folder. You may imagine that at the end of the day, our app will be composed of multiple bricks and call `ReactDOM.render` on the top level component.

#### About JSX
We just wrote our first React component. Didn't you notice something weird in that code? 
JS and HTML are mixed, in what we called __JSX__, that is a syntax extension to JS. JSX makes the code
less verbose, for instance:

```js
React.createElement(
  'h1',
  'Hello, world!'
);
```

does exactly the same thing as above but when the code becomes more complex, it is nearly
impossible to read. 

Let's see how to pass variables into JSX. We want to show `Hello, <Your Name>`, we store
the name in a variable and modify the `app.js` code accordingly:

```jsx
function App() {
  const name = "David";
  return (
    <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>
  );
}
```

Expressions are passed within curly brackets `{expression}` and you may even call functions inside.
Tag attributes also require curly brackets. Let's modify the title tag to give it a color and 
a size.

```jsx
function App() {
  const name = "David";
  return (
    <h1 style={color: "red", fontSize: 40}>Hello, {name}</h1>
  );
}
```

Try to save. Why does this fail? We can't pass multiple object properties inside a single `{}`.
We need either double brackets like `{{object properties: values, ...}}` or to store the object in 
a variable before:

```jsx
function App() {
  const name = "David";
  return (
    <h1 style={{color: "red", fontSize: 40}}>Hello, {name}</h1>
  );
}

// OR

function App() {
  const name = "David";
  const myStyle = {
    color: "red", 
    fontSize: 40
  }
  return (
    <h1 style={myStyle}>Hello, {name}</h1>
  );
}
```

Notice that we write CSS properties following the __camelCase__ syntax, `font-size` being equivalent to `fontSize`.

#### Combining components
The whole interest is to combine multiple components to create reusable pieces. We edit the above code 
to create a `SayHello` component. Notice the __props__ parameter. It is a way to pass configuration from the parent component. In that case, we want to display the person name, that is `props.name`. In the meantime, we edit the `App` parent component and call `SayHello` three times, passing a different name like `<SayHello name="David" />` (this is the reason why we recover `props.name` in the lower level component):

```jsx
function SayHello(props) {
  return (
    <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
  );
}


function App() {
  return(
  <>
    <SayHello name="David" />
    <SayHello name="Lisa" />
    <SayHello name="Simon" />
  </>
  );
}
```

::: {.noteblock data-latex=""}
Notice the enclosing `<>...</>`. This is called a React __fragment__ and useful if we don't want to
insert any extra `<div>` in the DOM. 
:::

We could be even more efficient by leveraging the lists capabilities. We create an array
of names and apply the `map` method to return the corresponding `<SayHello />` sub-component:

```jsx
const names = ["David", "Lisa", "Simon"];
function App() {
  const sayHelloToAll = names.map(
    (name) => <SayHello key={name} name={name} />
  ); 
  return(sayHelloToAll);
}
```

::: {.warningblock data-latex=""}
By convention, all elements inside a `map` require __keys__. 
:::

__Props__ are __read-only__ and must not be modified withing their own component. 
How do we update components then?

#### Component state
A component __state__ is private and controlled by this same component. Since React 16.8 and the introduction of __hooks__, this is not necessary to convert the component function to a [class](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components). 
The easiest example to illustrate hooks capabilities is the button. Each time, we click on a button,
we want to keep the current number of clicks in a state, like the `actionButton()`. We start by
importing the `useState` function from `react` and create a new `ActionButton` component. 
Inside, we set the state with `useState` that create the state variable `count` as well as the function to update it, namely `setCount`. This way to create two variables at once is called array __destructuring__. We set the initial number of counts to 0: 

```jsx
import {useState} from 'react';

function ActionButton() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
}
```

Next step is to create the button skeleton. We provide an `onClick` property that updates
the button state. Inside, we write an anonymous function which calls `setCount` and increments
the count value by 1. At this point, you may replace the `app.js` content by:

```jsx
import {useState} from 'react';

function ActionButton() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return(
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Number of clicks: {count}
    </button >
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <ActionButton />
  );
}

export default App;
```

We may improve the previous app and add a reset button within the `ActionButton` component that
sets the count back to 0:

```jsx
function ActionButton() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return(
    <>
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Number of clicks: {count}
    </button >
    <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>
      Reset
    </button >
    </>
  );
}
```

It would make more sense to only show the reset button once the button has been clicked,
at least once. We define the `isResetVisible` variable which is `true` whenever the
count is higher than 0 and `false` if the count is 0, leveraging the JS __ternary__ operator. We store the reset button in a variable and only return something if `isResetVisible` is `true`:

```jsx
function ActionButton() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const isResetVisible = count > 0 ? true : false;
  let resetButton;
  if (isResetVisible) {
    resetButton = <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>
      Reset
    </button >
  }
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Number of clicks: {count}
      </button >
      {resetButton}
    </>
  );
}
```

That's all folks! Now that you get a better understanding of how React works, 
let's see how to use it with Shiny. 

## Introduction to `{reactR}`
The React ecosystem is rich and provides many plug and play boilerplate. For instance,
`{reactable}` is an HTML widget developed on top of the [`react-table`](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table) library. What about the modern React Argon design [system](https://demos.creative-tim.com/argon-design-system-react/?_ga=2.179634850.760978196.1612189904-282783983.1612189904#/), shown Figure \@ref(fig:argon-design-react)?

```{r argon-design-react, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Argon design template with React', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/going-further/argon-design-react.png")
```

In this part, we see how to leverage `{reactR}` to bring the Argon design React template to Shiny.

To install `{reactR}`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# stable from CRAN
install.packages("reactR")

# lastest from GitHub
remotes::install_github("react-R/reactR")
```

### Scaffold inputs

#### Setup
`{reactR}` exposes the `scaffoldReactShinyInput()` that sets the necessary pieces of code
to get started with the input development (see Figure \@ref(fig:reactR-init-input)):

  - An `<input_name>.R` file containing the input skeleton as well as its related update function.
  It also creates a custom HTML dependency pointing to the input JS logic.
  - A `jsx` file with a boilerplate to start developing the input JS logic.
  - A `package.json` file containing dependencies.

Besides, providing an optional dependency with a name and version taken from __npm__ installs
all necessary dependencies in the `package.json` file. 
  
In our case, we want to build on top of Argon from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/argon-design-system-react):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
path <- file.path(tempdir(), "mypkg")
usethis::create_package(path, rstudio = TRUE)
reactR::scaffoldReactShinyInput(
  "argon_action_button", 
  list(
    "argon-design-system-react" = "^1.1.0"
  )
)
```

```{r reactR-init-input, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Package initialization with {reactR}', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/going-further/reactR-init-input.png")
```

Note that `{reactR}` provides __webpack__ as JS manager. To __build__ the JS code we go to the RStudio
terminal tab (or any terminal) and run at the package root:

```
yarn install
yarn run webpack --mode=development
```

This installs all dependencies listed in the `package.json` file and create a `package-lock.json` file. If you ever used `{renv}`, this is very similar and guarantees isolation of your package. All dependencies are stored in the `node_modules` folder.

::: {.importantblock data-latex=""}
We encountered few cases where the `yarn install` failed. In that case, downgrade your Node version to v12.x using `npx n 12`. In addition to downgrading Node, you might need to [tell `npm` to use `python` version 2.7](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/3519#issuecomment-395281871) and run `npm i argon-design-system-react`. If you are still running into errors, double check your VPN settings. To check whether argon is properly installed, the `argon-design-system-react` package folder should exist inside __./node_modules__.
:::

The `run webpack` command compiles the JS in production ready code. Should you need to customize the build pipeline, the webpack configuration is located in `webpack.config.js`. On the R side, the generated JS file is referenced in an HTML dependencies, located in the `<input_name>.R` file. 
If you specify the `--mode=development` tag, it falls back to development code. 

#### Implement the input JS logic
It's time to develop the logic. The Argon documentation provides a [boilerplate](https://demos.creative-tim.com/argon-design-system-react/#/documentation/buttons), which we slightly simplified, as show below:

```jsx
import { reactShinyInput } from 'reactR';
// reactstrap components
import { Button } from "reactstrap";

function ArgonButton() {
  return (
    <Button color="primary" type="button">
      Button
    </Button>
  );
}

reactShinyInput(
  '.argon_action_button', 
  'mypkg.argon_action_button', 
  ArgonButton
);
```

::: {.noteblock data-latex=""}
As you can see, we also need __reactstrap__ which is a Bootstrap React template. Install it with `yarn add --dev reactstrap`
:::

Notice the first two lines where we import the `reactShinyInput` function from the `{reactR}` JS core and [`reactstrap`](https://reactstrap.github.io/), a React powered Bootstrap 4 library. `reactShinyInput` provides a wrapper to automatically __bind__ the input element. This is extremely convenient as it allows to solely focus on the component logic rather than binding it to the shiny system. It takes three parameters:

  - The __element__ class which is obtained from the R side by `createReactShinyInput()`.
  - The __input binding__ name which is useful to store a reference in the `Shiny.InputBindings` registry.
  - The React __component__ function. 
  - There is an optional fourth parameter allowing to pass custom __options__ like
  rate [policies](https://github.com/react-R/reactR/blob/7dccb68a0989cf642d4a5a3eb90b59d1ae773002/srcjs/input.js#L137). 
  
Overall, [`reactShinyInput`](https://github.com/react-R/reactR/blob/7dccb68a0989cf642d4a5a3eb90b59d1ae773002/srcjs/input.js#L72) extends the `Shiny.InputBinding` class by providing extra methods like:
  
```js
getInputConfiguration(el) {
  return $(el).data('configuration');
}
setInputConfiguration(el, configuration) {
  $(el).data('configuration', configuration);
}
```

`getInputConfiguration` and `setInputConfiguration`, respectively get and set the user provided configuration, passed in the `createReactShinyInput()` R side function. Under the hood, in addition to ship the `{reactR}`, React, ReactTools HTML dependencies (and any user defined custom dependency), `createReactShinyInput()` does generate three tag elements:

  - The first tag is the element placeholder containing the unique __id__. React will insert 
  the component inside this target with `ReactDOM.render`. 
  - The second tag is a script containing the __value__ passed as __JSON__. 
  - The second tag is a script containing the __configuration__, also passed as JSON.
  
```{r}
reactR::createReactShinyInput(
  inputId = "plop", 
  class = "myinput", 
  dependencies = htmltools::findDependencies(icon("bicycle")), 
  default = 0, 
  configuration = list(a = 1, b = "test"), 
  container = div
)
```
  
The configuration and values are processed in the __initialize__ method, which is a great place since it is called before the input is bound:

```js
// Within reactR's initialize method...
$(el).data('value', JSON.parse($(el).next().text()));
$(el).data(
  'configuration', 
  JSON.parse($(el).next().next().text())
);
```

They are stored in the corresponding data attributes. The most important part is the __render__ method that creates the React element , based upon its configuration, value and renders it in the DOM:

```js
// reactR's render method
render(el) {
  const element = React.createElement(component, {
    configuration: this.getInputConfiguration(el),
    value: this.getValue(el),
    setValue: this.setValue.bind(this, el),
    el: el
  });
  ReactDOM.render(element, el);
}
```

The `render` method is called once inside `subscribe` and also each time the element is updated
with `receiveMessage`. 

Interestingly, `setValue` is made available to the React component. For the action button case, it is called each time the `onClick` event is triggered, that is each time the user clicks on the button. This is the only way to update its value since it is not accessible to the user through `update_argon_action_buttonInput()`. Other inputs like `textInput()` have the `onChange` event, fired each time the text field is updated. The value may also be updated 
by the user with `updateTextInput()`. Consequently, there is no general rule and the situation may
vary from an input to another!

For now, let's just erase the `{reactR}` boilerplate (`argon_action_button.jsx`) with the above code an recompile with `yarn run webpack`. We also have to tell Shiny we want to
use Bootstrap 4 instead of Bootstrap 3, through the `bslib::bs_theme` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::document()
devtools::load_all()
library(shiny)
library(mypkg)

ui <- fluidPage(
  theme = bslib::bs_theme(version = "4"),
  argon_action_buttonInput("plop")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

The button is looking good but not really like in the Argon design system. Indeed, we forgot to import
the argon CSS assets. Add this code to the `argon_action_button.jsx`:

```js
import argonAssets + "argon-design-system-react/src/assets/css/argon-design-system-react.min.css";
```

Under the hood, __webpack__ knows how to load CSS in the `webpack.config.js`:

```js
rules: [
  {
      test: /\.jsx?$/,
      loader: 'babel-loader',
      options: {
          presets: ['@babel/preset-env', '@babel/preset-react']
      }
  },
  // For CSS so that import "path/style.css"; works
  {
      test: /\.css$/,
      use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader']
  }
]
```

The next part of this tutorial consists in making the button interactive. 
We edit the `argon_action_button.jsx` code to add three input parameters in the
`ArgonButton` component:

  - __value__ is the button count. The initial value is provided by the `default` slot on the R side (see below). 
  - __configuration__ contains various user provided properties like the color status, outline style, ...
  - __setValue__ is a way to increment the button value. Letting `setValue(value + 1)`,
  ensures to increment the button value by 1 unit each click. 

```jsx
import { reactShinyInput } from 'reactR';
// reactstrap components
import { Button } from "reactstrap";
// Import argon CSS
import "argon-design-system-react/src/assets/css/argon-design-system-react.min.css";

function ArgonButton({configuration, value, setValue}) {
  return (
    <Button 
      color={configuration.status} 
      type="button" 
      onClick={() => setValue(value + 1)}>
      {configuration.label}
    </Button>
  );
}

reactShinyInput(
  '.argon_action_button', 
  'mypkg.argon_action_button', 
  ArgonButton
);
```

On the R side, we remove the `default` parameter from the external API but keep it internally to
set the initial value to 0, like for `shiny::actionButton`. Status and label are stored
in the configuration named list. Be careful! Names matter since they are recovered on the JS side
with `configuration.prop_name`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
argon_action_buttonInput <- function(
  inputId, 
  label, 
  status = "primary"
) {
  reactR::createReactShinyInput(
    inputId,
    "argon_action_button",
    htmltools::htmlDependency(
      name = "argon_action_button-input",
      version = "1.0.0",
      src = "www/mypkg/argon_action_button",
      package = "mypkg",
      script = "argon_action_button.js"
    ),
    default = 0,
    configuration = list(
      label = label,
      status = status
    ),
    htmltools::tags$div
  )
}
```

Once everything is up to date, we rebuild the JS, reload/document the package and run the app demo:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  theme = bslib::bs_theme(version = "4"),
  argon_action_buttonInput("plop", "Click me!")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  observe(print(input$plop))
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

We may also modify the update input boilerplate since we don't change the button value:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
update_argon_action_buttonInput <- function(
  session, 
  inputId, 
  configuration = NULL
) {
  message <- list()
  if (!is.null(configuration)) {
    message$configuration <- configuration
  }
  session$sendInputMessage(inputId, message);
}

devtools::document()
devtools::load_all()
ui <- fluidPage(
  theme = bslib::bs_theme(version = "4"),
  fluidRow(
    argon_action_buttonInput("plop", "Click me!"),
    argon_action_buttonInput("update", "Update button 1")
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  observe(print(input$plop))
  observeEvent(input$update, {
    update_argon_action_buttonInput(
      session, "plop", 
      configuration = list(
        label = "New text", 
        status = "success"
      )
    )
  }, ignoreInit = TRUE)
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```


#### Exercise
1. Add a `size`, `outline` and `icon` (from fontawesome) parameters to the `ArgonButton` component in the corresponding R script.
Hint: the `icon` parameter is the trickiest one. You might find helpful to capture its HTML dependency with `htmltools::htmlDependencies(iconTag)` so as to properly render it. In HTML `icon("bicycle")` produces `<i class="fa fa-bicycle" role="presentation" aria-label="bicycle icon"></i>`. However, in React we want `<i className="fa fa-bicycle />`. Therefore, you will have to extract the icon class and send it to JS in the configuration list.
2. Implement the logic on the JS side. Hint: you may use the below code:

```jsx
import { reactShinyInput } from 'reactR';
// reactstrap components
import { Button } from "reactstrap";
// import argon CSS
import "argon-design-system-react/src/assets/css/argon-design-system-react.min.css";

function ArgonButton({configuration, value, setValue}) {
  let iconTag, btnCl, innerTag;
  if (...) {
    btnCl = "btn-icon";
    innerTag = <>
      <span className="btn-inner--icon">
        <i className=... />
      </span>
      <span className="btn-inner--text">...</span>
    </>;
  } else {
    innerTag = configuration.label;
  }

  let outlined;
  if (...) {
    outlined = true;
  }

  return (
    <Button
      color={configuration.status}
      type="button"
      className=...
      outline=...
      size=...
      onClick={() => setValue(value + 1)}>
      {innerTag}
    </Button>
  );
}

reactShinyInput(
  '.argon_action_button', 
  'mypkg.argon_action_button', 
  ArgonButton
);
```
3. Try your code with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(mypkg)

ui <- fluidPage(
  theme = bslib::bs_theme(version = "4"),
  fluidRow(
    argon_action_buttonInput(
      "plop", 
      "Click me!", 
      size = "lg", 
      outline = TRUE
    ),
    argon_action_buttonInput(
      "update", 
      "Update button 1", 
      icon = icon("bicycle")
    )
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  observe(print(input$plop))
  observeEvent(input$update, {
    update_argon_action_buttonInput(
      session, "plop", 
      configuration = list(
        label = "New text", 
        status = "success"
      )
    )
  }, ignoreInit = TRUE)
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

You should get the result shown Figure \@ref(fig:react-action-button).

```{r react-action-button, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Argon Action button with React', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/going-further/react-action-button.png")
```


### A slider input
Below we propose a preliminary implementation of the Argon slider input. The [documentation](https://demos.creative-tim.com/argon-design-system-react/?_ga=2.179634850.760978196.1612189904-282783983.1612189904#/documentation/forms) provides a JSX skeleton:

```jsx
{/* Simple slider */}
<div className="input-slider-container">
  <div className="slider" ref="slider1" />
  <Row className="mt-3 d-none">

The slider JS API is actually taken from the well known [noUiSlider](https://refreshless.com/nouislider/) library and is already available in the package node modules. Still in the same package, we can call:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
reactR::scaffoldReactShinyInput("argon_slider", edit = FALSE)
```

It creates a new `srcjs/argon_slider.jsx` script. As Argon uses the pure JS API for noUIslider, 
this would be too much work for us mainly because the provided `reactShinyInput` JS helper does not have a proper initialization method to create the slider instance. We would have to change it as per below:

```js
initialize(el) {
  // Unchanged compared to reactR
  $(el).data('value', JSON.parse($(el).next().text()));
  $(el).data(
    'configuration', 
    JSON.parse($(el).next().next().text())
  );
  
  // Create the slider instance 
  self = this;
  Slider.create($(el).attr(id), {
    start: self.getInputValue(el),
    connect: [true, false],
    step: self.getInputConfiguration(el).step,
    range: { 
      min: self.getInputConfiguration(el).min, 
      max: self.getInputConfiguration(el).max 
    }
  });
}
```

as well as updating methods like `setInputValue`, `setInputConfiguration`. Fortunately, 
there is already a [nouislider-react](https://mmarkelov.github.io/react-nouislider/) API, which will
makes our job much easier than shown above. To add the new dependency we run:

```
yarn add nouislider-react
// or
npm i nouislider-react
```

and replace the import statement inside our JSX file to rely on `nouislider-react`. 
The `Nouislider` component markup is fairly intuitive. We set the min and max as well as the current value:

```jsx
import { reactShinyInput } from 'reactR';
import Nouislider from "nouislider-react";

function ArgonSlider({configuration, value, setValue}) {
  const rangeOpts = {
    min: configuration.min,
    max: configuration.max
  };
  return(
    <Nouislider
      range={rangeOpts}
      start={value}
      connect={[true, false]}
    />
  );
}

reactShinyInput(
  '.argon_slider', 
  'mypkg.argon_slider', 
  ArgonSlider
);
```

The `connect` property makes the slider bar background filled with the theme color. Figure \@ref(fig:react-argon-slider) shows what happens when this parameter is disabled.

As we start to accumulate components, it is good practice to start modularizing our code. We create a `main.jsx` file containing the necessary code to load the common CSS assets and initialize both the button and slider components:

```jsx
// Import argon CSS
import "argon-design-system-react/src/assets/css/argon-design-system-react.min.css";

import initArgonButton from './argon_action_button.jsx';
import initArgonSlider from './argon_slider.jsx';

initArgonButton();
initArgonSlider();
```

The `argon_slider.jsx` looks like, where we export a __default__ function, namely `initArgonSlider`:

```jsx
import { reactShinyInput } from 'reactR';
import Nouislider from "nouislider-react";

function ArgonSlider({configuration, value, setValue}) {
  const rangeOpts = {
    min: configuration.min,
    max: configuration.max
  };
  return(
    <Nouislider
      range={rangeOpts}
      start={value}
      connect={[true, false]}
    />
  );
}

export default function initArgonSlider(){
  return reactShinyInput(
    '.argon_slider',
    'mypkg.argon_slider',
    ArgonSlider
  );
}
```

We have to modify the `webpack.config.js` to change the entry point to `main.jsx`, whose output will be `argon.js`:

```js
entry: [
  path.join(__dirname, 'srcjs', 'main.jsx')
],
output: {
  path: path.join(__dirname, 'inst/www/mypkg/argon'),
  filename: 'argon.js'
}
```

This means we have to update the HTML dependency on the R side, for instance for 
the `argon_slider_input.R`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
argon_slider_input <- function(inputId, value, 
                               default = value, min, max) {
  reactR::createReactShinyInput(
    inputId,
    "argon_slider",
    htmltools::htmlDependency(
      name = "argon",
      version = "1.0.0",
      src = "www/mypkg/argon",
      package = "mypkg",
      script = "argon.js"
    ),
    default,
    list(
      min = min,
      max = max
    ),
    htmltools::tags$div
  )
}
```

After rebuilding the JS and R package, we can run the app below:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  theme = bslib::bs_theme(version = "4"),
  argon_slider_input("plop", 10, min = 0, max = 100)
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  observe(print(input$plop))
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

As shown on Figure \@ref(fig:react-argon-slider), the slider is properly displayed and the value
is recovered from the server. However, nothing happens when the range is dragged. 
The reason is quite simple: we did not set the __setValue__ inside our JSX code yet.

```{r react-argon-slider, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Slider input with Argon React', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/going-further/react-argon-slider.png")
```

The slider API provides many [events](https://refreshless.com/nouislider/events-callbacks/) but not all
are suitable for us. Ideally, we would like an update:

  - Each time the range is released after dragging.
  - Each time the range is moved by arrow key (keyboard).
  
This seems like a perfect shot for the __onChange__ prop. Let's add it to the `ArgonSlider` component:

```jsx
function ArgonSlider({configuration, value, setValue, el}) {
  const rangeOpts = {
    min: configuration.min,
    max: configuration.max
  };

  return(
    <Nouislider
      range={rangeOpts}
      start={[value]}
      connect={[true, false]}
      onChange={() => setValue()}
    />
  );
}
```

What value should we pass to `setValue`? This is quite easy to recover the slider value
directly within the React component. We pass a parameter to the function, which will recover the
latest value:

```jsx
value => setValue(parseFloat(value))
```

The trick is to convert the value to a number since we recover a string by default. You may 
use `parseInt` or `parseFloat`, depending whether you want a integer or the exact value.
Right now, the slider cannot be moved with the keyboard. Adding the `keyboardSupport` prop
make it possible. This may correspond to a parameter provided in the `argon_slider_input()` configuration. The `tooltips` parameter enhances the user experience by showing the current value, on top of the slider, while `pips` add a simple grid. Not mentioned in the documentation, we add some CSS properties (top and bottom margins) to improve the display. Importantly, as the update slider function passes a named list to JS, any missing property is dropped, which can lead to undefined values on the JS side and unexpected behavior. Therefore, it is good to put default values whenever necessary to avoid this kind of issue. For instance, assume you passed `orientation = "horizontal"` upon slider creation and forgot to put that parameter in the update list, you can do the following in the JSX code:

```jsx
if (configuration.orientation === undefined) {
  configuration.orientation = "horizontal";
}
```

The whole component code may be found below:

```jsx
function ArgonSlider({configuration, value, setValue, el}) {
  const rangeOpts = {
    min: configuration.min,
    max: configuration.max
  };
  
  // Better margins
  const sliderStyle = {marginTop: "50px", marginBottom: "50px"};
  
  // Grid
  const pipOpts = {
    mode: 'range',
    density: 3
  };
  
  return(
    <Nouislider
      style={sliderStyle}
      range={rangeOpts}
      start={[value]}
      connect={[true, false]}
      onChange={value => setValue(parseFloat(value))}
      keyboardSupport={configuration.keyboard}
      tooltips={configuration.tooltips}
      pips={pipOpts}
    />
  );
}
```

The `argon_slider_input()` is given by:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
argon_slider_input <- function(inputId, value, default = value, 
                               min, max, keyboard = TRUE,
                               tooltips = TRUE) {
  reactR::createReactShinyInput(
    inputId,
    "argon_slider",
    htmltools::htmlDependency(
      name = "argon",
      version = "1.0.0",
      src = "www/mypkg/argon",
      package = "mypkg",
      script = "argon.js"
    ),
    default,
    list(
      min = min,
      max = max,
      keyboardSupport = keyboard,
      tooltips = tooltips
    ),
    htmltools::tags$div
  )
}
```

There are many more parameters that can be added to the following [API](https://refreshless.com/nouislider/slider-options/). We leave it as an
exercise for the reader. 

Finally, let's see how `update_argon_slider_input()` works:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  theme = bslib::bs_theme(version = "4"),
  argon_slider_input("plop", 10, min = 0, max = 100),
  br(),
  argon_action_button("update", "Update button 1")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  observe(print(input$plop))
  observeEvent(input$update, {
    update_argon_slider_input(
      session, "plop",
      value = 100,
      configuration = list(
        min = 0,
        max = 200,
        tooltips = FALSE,
        keyboardSupport = FALSE
      )
    )
  }, ignoreInit = TRUE)
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

The `keyboardSupport` option does not seem changed, neither is the `tooltips` option. Actually, 
only that [list](https://refreshless.com/nouislider/more/#section-update) may be modified. Let's address this below.
The `nouiSlider` React API provides internal access to the slider instance from within the
[component](https://github.com/mmarkelov/react-nouislider#using-with-ref). To make it work, we have to leverage the React Hook feature:

  - Create a __Hook__ hosting the component reference and a method to update it with `React.useState`.
  - Update the instance option each time the component is re-rendered by Shiny.
  
```jsx
const [ref, setRef] = React.useState(null);

const setConfiguration = () => {
  if (ref && ref.noUiSlider) {
    ref.noUiSlider.updateOptions(configuration);
  }
};

setConfiguration();
```

We must specify the `instanceRef` property which will capture the slider reference when available and update
the local ref:

```jsx
<Nouislider
  style={sliderStyle}
  keyboardSupport={configuration.keyboard}
  connect={[true, false]}
  range={rangeOpts}
  start={[value]}
  onChange={value => setValue(parseFloat(value))}
  tooltips={configuration.tooltips}
  pips={pipOpts}
  instanceRef={
    instance => {
      if (instance && !ref) {
        setRef(instance);
      }
    }
  }
/>
```

We recompile the code and run the previous example. While the tooltip is gone, 
the keyboard interaction is still there. This is not surprising as `updateOptions` does
not handle all settings. The final result is displayed Figure \@ref(fig:react-argon-slider-final).

```{r react-argon-slider-final, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Slider input with Argon React with more options', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/going-further/react-argon-slider-final.png")
```
