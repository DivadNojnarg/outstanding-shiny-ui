## Motivations
Adapting an external HTML template to R requires time, efforts and competent people. 
What if, instead, we decided to:

  - Handle the UI part with HTML, JS and CSS.
  - Handle the server part with R. 
  - Communicate between R and JS with the websocket to exchange information. 
  
Theoretically, any front-end web developer could take care of the first task. 
The second task could be handled by any R programmer. The third task involves both developers, the R guy will leverage `session$sendCustomMessage` and the UI guy will use `Shiny.setInputvalue`. 

Eventually, this would allow the R guy, that is most of the time not a UI design expert, to focus on the business logic and extract function out of `reactive` to avoid sub optimal apps. On the other hands, the web developer could focus on building the user interface and prepare the link with the R part, without necessarily have a deep knowledge of R.


## Start of the art
Let's make a list of all requirements for such a project. Since we are working with both web languages and R, we may leverage `{packer}` [@R-packer] that briefly allows to use `webpack`, a JavaScript bundler in any R project. Moreover, we need a robust R package template structure for Shiny, which is a good task for `{golem}`. As for the icing on the cake, `{packer}` offers a plug and play function to set up a `{golem}` project with `webpack`, through `packer::scaffold_golem()`.

An excellent introduction exposing how to maintain robust JavaScript code inside a Shiny project, featuring Webpack and NPM, may be found in [JavaScript for R](https://book.javascript-for-r.com/webpack-intro.html) by John Coene.
